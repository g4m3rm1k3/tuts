Got it! Let’s do Step 2 fully in the **narrative, in-depth style** you want—no bullet shortcuts, no arrows, full explanations of what, why, how, alternatives, and gotchas. Here’s the full rewrite:

# Step 2: Authentication – The Secure Handshake (Client-Server Trust – 1.5hr)

The goal of Step 2 is to build a proper login system. This is where the frontend collects the user’s credentials and sends them to the backend securely. The backend checks the credentials without ever storing plain passwords, then returns a token to prove the user is authenticated. The frontend stores this token so the user stays logged in even if they refresh the page. By completing this step, you’ll understand how a client and server establish a secure “handshake” and maintain trust, which is fundamental for any application with private data, like a G-code uploader restricted to authorized users.

We start by creating a branch for this step:

```bash
git checkout -b step-2-auth
```

The first visual piece is a login button. This goes into your `index.html` header:

```html
<button data-action="login" class="bg-green-500 text-white px-4 py-2 rounded">
  Login
</button>
```

This button is not functional yet; it just signals intent. The `data-action="login"` attribute allows our JavaScript to detect clicks without hardcoding behavior into the HTML. Using data attributes keeps the HTML “dumb” while the JS handles the logic.

Next, we create a popup for the login form. This is added just before `</body>` in `index.html`:

```html
<div
  id="loginModal"
  class="fixed inset-0 bg-black bg-opacity-50 flex items-center justify-center hidden z-50"
>
  <div class="bg-white p-6 rounded shadow-lg">
    <input
      id="loginUsername"
      placeholder="Username"
      class="block w-full mb-2 p-2 border rounded"
    />
    <input
      id="loginPassword"
      type="password"
      placeholder="Password"
      class="block w-full mb-2 p-2 border rounded"
    />
    <button data-action="submitLogin">Submit</button>
  </div>
</div>
```

Here, `fixed inset-0` ensures the modal covers the whole screen. `hidden` keeps it invisible until triggered. The `z-50` ensures it sits above all other content. The inputs collect the username and password, and `type="password"` obscures the text for security. The “Submit” button will later trigger our fetch request.

### Client-Side State – Remembering the User

On the frontend, we need a way to remember who is logged in and maintain the session. For this, we create `ui/auth.js`:

```javascript
let authToken = null;
let currentUser = null;
```

`authToken` will hold the token the server sends after successful login, and `currentUser` stores the username. Using `let` allows these values to change; starting as `null` means “empty but intentional.” If you used `const`, you couldn’t update them later. These variables live at the module level so any function in `auth.js` can access them.

To persist across page reloads, we pull from `localStorage`:

```javascript
authToken = localStorage.getItem("auth_token") || null;
currentUser = localStorage.getItem("current_user") || null;
```

`localStorage` survives refreshes and tab closes. The `|| null` ensures a safe fallback if nothing is stored yet. An alternative would be `sessionStorage`, which only lasts until the tab closes. This choice depends on whether you want longer-lived sessions.

---

### Backend Authentication – Hashing and Token Issuance

The backend should never store plain passwords. Instead, we use a hashing function. In `backend/auth.py`, we use `bcrypt`:

```python
import bcrypt

def hash_password(password: str) -> str:
    salt = bcrypt.gensalt()
    hashed = bcrypt.hashpw(password.encode(), salt)
    return hashed.decode()
```

`gensalt()` generates random bits to add to the password before hashing, making each hash unique. `hashpw` applies the actual hashing. Encoding converts the string to bytes for bcrypt, and decoding returns a string suitable for storage. The key principle: even if the database is stolen, attackers cannot reverse the hash.

To verify a login attempt:

```python
def verify_password(plain_password: str, hashed: str) -> bool:
    return bcrypt.checkpw(plain_password.encode(), hashed.encode())
```

`checkpw` hashes the input using the stored salt and compares it to the stored hash. If they match, the user knows the correct password without the server ever seeing the plain text. Alternatives exist, like `hashlib.sha256`, but bcrypt is intentionally slow to make brute-force attacks impractical.

---

### Client-Server Wiring – Submitting the Login

In `ui/auth.js`, we implement a function to read the form values and send them to the backend:

```javascript
export async function performLogin() {
    const username = document.getElementById("loginUsername").value;
    const password = document.getElementById("loginPassword").value;
    
    const formData = new FormData();
    formData.append("username", username);
    formData.append("password", password);
    
    try {
        const response = await fetch("/auth/login", {
            method: "POST",
            body: formData,
        });
        console.log("Response:", response.status);
    } catch (error) {
        console.error("Send failed:", error);
    }
}
```

`getElementById` reads the user input. `FormData` safely packages it for a POST request, ensuring sensitive data is not exposed in URLs. `fetch` sends it asynchronously, and `await` pauses execution until a response arrives. Using POST is important because GET would append credentials to the URL, visible in logs and history.

---

### Wrapping Up

Step 2 establishes a secure login system. The flow is: user clicks login → modal opens → user types credentials → JS reads inputs → bundles FormData → sends POST request → backend hashes and verifies → returns token → frontend stores token for persistence. Following the Single Responsibility Principle, `auth.js` manages state and submission, while `index.html` handles structure and `main.js` handles wiring events. Each piece can now be tested independently, and you have a secure foundation for all future interactions with your app.
