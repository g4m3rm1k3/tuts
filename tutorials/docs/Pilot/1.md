Absolutely—this is the perfect place to slow down and unpack everything. Think of this as “tramming the mill” before you cut: if the foundation is square, everything else builds cleanly. I’ll walk you through **every piece**: the folder structure, the CMake files, the C++ code, the Python binding, and the CLI. Along the way, I’ll explain _why_ we do it this way, not just _what_ it is.

# 🗂 Folder & File Structure

```
forge/
  CMakeLists.txt
  src/forge_core/
    CMakeLists.txt
    include/forge/core/version.hpp
    lib/version.cpp
  bindings/python/
    CMakeLists.txt
    forge_core_py.cpp
  python/forge_cli/
    __init__.py
    main.py
  tests/
    cpp/
    py/
```

### Why structure it like this?

- **`src/forge_core/`** → This is your **C++ engine room**. It’s where the “serious” code lives.

  - `include/` → Public headers (the “API” of your library). Other code includes these.
  - `lib/` → Implementation files (`.cpp`). These are private details.
  - This split mirrors how professional libraries are shipped: headers are public, `.cpp` is hidden.

- **`bindings/python/`** → The “glue” layer. This is where we use **pybind11** to expose C++ functions to Python. Keeping it separate prevents your core C++ from becoming polluted with Python‑specific code.

- **`python/forge_cli/`** → Pure Python code. This is your **user interface** (CLI, later API). It imports the binding module and orchestrates workflows. Think of it as the “operator console” for your CNC machine.

- **`tests/`** → Unit tests. Split into `cpp/` and `py/` so you can test both sides independently. This is like having a test block on the machine to prove out toolpaths before cutting real stock.

- **Top‑level `CMakeLists.txt`** → The master build script. It pulls in subdirectories and orchestrates the build.

This separation is your first taste of **Separation of Concerns (SoC)**: each layer has one job, and they don’t bleed into each other. That’s how you avoid “monolith creep.”

# ⚙️ CMake Explained

CMake is a **meta build system**. It doesn’t compile code itself—it generates build files for your platform (Ninja, MSVC, Makefiles, Xcode). Think of it as a **post‑processor**: you give it a high‑level description of your project, and it spits out the machine‑specific instructions.

### Top‑level `CMakeLists.txt`

```cmake
cmake_minimum_required(VERSION 3.20)
project(Forge LANGUAGES CXX)

set(CMAKE_CXX_STANDARD 20)
set(CMAKE_CXX_STANDARD_REQUIRED ON)

add_subdirectory(src/forge_core)
add_subdirectory(bindings/python)
```

- `cmake_minimum_required` → Ensures you’re using a modern enough CMake.
- `project(Forge LANGUAGES CXX)` → Names your project and declares it’s C++.
- `set(CMAKE_CXX_STANDARD 20)` → Forces C++20.
- `add_subdirectory(...)` → Tells CMake to descend into those folders and process their `CMakeLists.txt`.

So this file is like your **main program**; the subdirectories are functions.

---

### `src/forge_core/CMakeLists.txt`

```cmake
add_library(forge_core)
target_sources(forge_core PRIVATE lib/version.cpp)
target_include_directories(forge_core PUBLIC include)
```

- `add_library(forge_core)` → Defines a library target named `forge_core`.
- `target_sources` → Adds `.cpp` files to that library.
- `target_include_directories` → Tells consumers where to find headers. `PUBLIC` means: “I use these headers, and anyone linking me should too.”

This is like defining a **tool** in your CAM library: it has geometry (sources) and metadata (headers).

---

### `bindings/python/CMakeLists.txt`

```cmake
find_package(pybind11 REQUIRED)

pybind11_add_module(forge_core_py forge_core_py.cpp)
target_link_libraries(forge_core_py PRIVATE forge_core)
```

- `find_package(pybind11 REQUIRED)` → Locates pybind11 on your system.
- `pybind11_add_module(...)` → Special macro that builds a Python extension module.
- `target_link_libraries` → Links it against your C++ core library.

This is like bolting an **adapter** onto your spindle so it can hold a different tool: pybind11 adapts C++ to Python.

---

# 💻 The C++ Code

### `version.hpp`

```cpp
#pragma once
#include <string_view>

namespace forge::core {
    constexpr std::string_view version() { return "0.1.0"; }
}
```

- `#pragma once` → Prevents multiple inclusion.
- `namespace forge::core` → Namespacing avoids collisions.
- `constexpr std::string_view version()` → A compile‑time constant function returning the version string.

This is your **“Hello, World”** of a library: a trivial function to prove the pipeline works.

---

### `version.cpp`

```cpp
#include "forge/core/version.hpp"
// Nothing else yet—just linking the header.
```

This file is basically a placeholder. In real libraries, `.cpp` files contain the heavy lifting, while headers declare the interface.

---

# 🧩 The Python Binding

### `forge_core_py.cpp`

```cpp
#include <pybind11/pybind11.h>
#include <forge/core/version.hpp>

namespace py = pybind11;

PYBIND11_MODULE(forge_core_py, m) {
    m.def("version", [] { return std::string(forge::core::version()); });
}
```

- `PYBIND11_MODULE(forge_core_py, m)` → Macro that defines a Python module named `forge_core_py`.
- `m.def("version", ...)` → Exposes a function called `version` to Python.
- `[] { return std::string(...); }` → A lambda that calls your C++ function and returns a Python string.

So when you `import forge_core_py` in Python, you’re actually loading a compiled `.pyd` (Windows) or `.so` (Linux) file that wraps your C++.

---

# 🐍 The Python CLI

### `main.py`

```python
import argparse
import forge_core_py

def main():
    parser = argparse.ArgumentParser(prog="forge")
    parser.add_argument("--version", action="store_true")
    args = parser.parse_args()

    if args.version:
        print(f"Forge core: {forge_core_py.version()}")
    else:
        print("Forge CLI. Try --version")

if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
```

- `argparse` → Standard library for parsing CLI arguments.
- `forge_core_py.version()` → Calls into your C++ code.
- `if __name__ == "__main__":` → Standard Python entry point.

This is your **operator console**: a simple CLI that proves the pipeline works end‑to‑end.

---

# 🔄 Build & Run

```bash
cmake -S . -B build -G "Ninja"
cmake --build build
python -m python.forge_cli.main --version
```

- `cmake -S . -B build` → Configure the project. `-S` = source dir, `-B` = build dir.
- `-G "Ninja"` → Generator: Ninja is fast and cross‑platform.
- `cmake --build build` → Actually compiles.
- `python -m python.forge_cli.main --version` → Runs your CLI, which calls into C++.

Expected output:

```
Forge core: 0.1.0
```

# 🧠 Reflection

- You now understand **why we separate code**: core logic, bindings, CLI, and tests each live in their own layer.
- You’ve seen **CMake as a post‑processor**: it translates your high‑level project description into platform‑specific build instructions.
- You’ve built your first **C++ → Python bridge**. This pattern will repeat constantly.

---

# 📝 Exercises

1. Change the version string in C++ to `"0.1.1"`. Rebuild. Does Python reflect it?
2. Add a new C++ function `build_info()` that returns `"Forge build: Debug"` or `"Forge build: Release"`. Expose it to Python.
3. Explore the `build/` folder—notice how CMake generates platform‑specific files (Ninja build files, `.pyd` modules, etc.).

Michael, would you like me to **expand Module 1 further** into a “CMake 101” deep dive (targets, linking, include paths, build types), or move on to **Module 2 (Binary/Text IO)** now that you’ve got the skeleton explained?
