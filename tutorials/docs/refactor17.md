Let's get to it. This next step is the most important and transformative part of our entire frontend refactor. We're going to fundamentally change how the application "thinks" about and manages its data.

### Stage 5.2: The Central State Store

We're going to create a file, `state/store.js`, that will act as the single "brain" or "memory" for our entire application. All the scattered global variables like `currentUser`, `groupedFiles`, and `isAdminModeEnabled` will be eliminated and replaced by this central store.

#### The "Why": From Chaos to Predictability

**The Problem with Global Variables:** Your original `script.js` uses many global variables to keep track of the application's state. Imagine trying to cook in a kitchen where any family member can walk in at any time and swap the salt for sugar without telling you. You'd get some unpredictable and buggy results\! This is what happens with global variables; any function can change them at any time, making it incredibly difficult to debug when something goes wrong.

**The Solution: A Single Source of Truth.** We will create a single JavaScript object to hold _all_ of our application's state. This is our **single source of truth**. If we need to know the current list of files, there is only one place to look.

**The Magic: The Publish/Subscribe Pattern.** How does the UI know when to update? We'll implement a simple but powerful pattern called "Pub/Sub."

- **Analogy:** Think of our state store as a newspaper publisher.
- **Subscribing:** A UI component (like the file list) "subscribes" to the newspaper. It tells the publisher, "I'm interested in the `files` topic. Please notify me whenever a new edition is published."
- **Publishing:** When an action happens (like an API call finishing), it tells the publisher to `setState`. The publisher updates the data and "publishes" a notification to all its subscribers.
- **Reacting:** The file list component receives the notification and automatically re-renders itself with the new data.

This **reactive data flow** is the core principle behind every modern frontend framework (like React or Vue). It makes your application predictable, easy to debug, and highly scalable.

#### Your Action Items

1. **Create the State Store**: Create a new file at `frontend/js/state/store.js` and add this heavily commented code. This is our "newspaper publisher."

```javascript
// frontend/js/state/store.js

// The single source of truth for our application's state.
const _state = {
  currentUser: null,
  isAdmin: false,
  groupedFiles: {},
  isConfigured: false,
  // We can add anything else our app needs to remember here.
};

// A list of all our "subscriber" functions.
const _listeners = [];

/**
 * The main engine of our store. It updates the state and notifies all subscribers.
 * This is the "publish" function.
 * @param {Object} partialState - An object with the parts of the state you want to change.
 */
export function setState(partialState) {
  // Merge the new state properties into our existing state object.
  Object.assign(_state, partialState);

  // Notify all listeners that the state has changed!
  // We pass them the new, complete state object.
  for (const listener of _listeners) {
    listener(_state);
  }
}

/**
 * Returns a copy of the current state.
 */
export function getState() {
  return { ..._state };
}

/**
 * Allows a function (like a UI component's render function) to "subscribe" to state updates.
 * @param {Function} listener - A function that will be called whenever the state changes.
 */
export function subscribe(listener) {
  _listeners.push(listener);
}
```

2. **Use the Store in `main.js`**: Now, let's update `frontend/js/main.js` to use this new system. This will demonstrate the reactive data flow.

```javascript
// frontend/js/main.js

import { formatDate } from "./utils/helpers.js";
import { getConfig, getFiles } from "./api/service.js";
// NEW: Import our state management functions
import { setState, subscribe, getState } from "./state/store.js";

// --- RENDER FUNCTION ---
// This function will be responsible for updating the UI. For now, it just logs to the console.
// It receives the complete, up-to-date state as its only argument.
function render(state) {
  console.log("üöÄ Render triggered! The new state is:", state);
  // In the next steps, we will add code here to update the DOM.
}

// --- INITIALIZATION LOGIC ---
async function initialize() {
  console.log("DOM fully loaded. Initializing app...");
  try {
    const config = await getConfig();
    console.log("‚úÖ Config loaded:", config);

    // Use setState to update our central store with the config info.
    setState({
      isConfigured: config.has_token,
      currentUser: config.username,
      isAdmin: config.is_admin,
    });

    if (config.has_token) {
      const filesData = await getFiles();
      console.log("‚úÖ Files loaded:", filesData);
      // Use setState again to update the files in our store.
      // This will automatically trigger our 'render' function!
      setState({ groupedFiles: filesData });
    }
  } catch (error) {
    console.error("‚ùå Initialization failed:", error.message);
  }
}

// --- APP START ---

// 1. Subscribe our render function to state changes.
// From now on, ANY call to setState() anywhere in the app will cause `render()` to run.
subscribe(render);

// 2. Start the application initialization process when the DOM is ready.
document.addEventListener("DOMContentLoaded", initialize);
```

---

Open your browser's developer console. You should see the "üöÄ Render triggered\!" log message appear automatically after the file data is fetched and `setState` is called. You've just created a reactive UI system\!

This is a huge conceptual leap. We've replaced chaos with a predictable, one-way data flow. Let me know when you're ready, and we'll build our first UI "component" that uses this new state store to render real HTML to the page.
