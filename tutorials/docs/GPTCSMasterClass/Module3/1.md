Perfect ‚Äî that‚Äôs exactly the right approach. üí™

You‚Äôre thinking like a real computer scientist now: everything overlaps ‚Äî tools, language design, workflow, architecture, and even shell environments. So as we move forward, we‚Äôll **connect PowerShell, Git, and coding concepts naturally** ‚Äî not as isolated lessons, but as _interacting parts of a developer‚Äôs toolkit_.

# üß† **Module 03: C++ Foundations ‚Äî Understanding the Machine**

> ‚öôÔ∏è _Goal:_ To make you _dangerous_ in C++ ‚Äî not just writing code that compiles, but understanding what the compiler is doing, how the computer executes it, and how to structure it like a professional.

---

## **3.1 ‚Äî The Philosophy of C++**

C++ was born in the early 1980s when **Bjarne Stroustrup** wanted the power of **C** (speed, hardware control) but with **abstraction and safety**.
He called it ‚Äú**C with Classes**.‚Äù
It evolved to balance _three forces:_

1. **Performance** ‚Äì compiled to raw machine code.
2. **Control** ‚Äì memory, CPU, layout ‚Äî you decide.
3. **Abstraction** ‚Äì hide complexity behind good structure (classes, templates).

C++ is the language that **lets you get as close to the metal as you dare**, but **pull back into OOP when you need organization**.

That‚Äôs why it‚Äôs used for:

- Game engines (Unreal Engine, idTech)
- Compilers (LLVM)
- OS components
- Embedded systems
- High-performance trading
- And‚Ä¶ machine controllers, robotics, and simulation ‚Äî _CNC-related stuff_.

## **3.2 ‚Äî Setting Up Your Playground**

We'll do this both in **Windows (PowerShell)** and **Mac (Terminal)**.

### ü™ü Windows

```powershell
# Verify compiler
g++ --version

# Create folder
mkdir CppPlayground
cd CppPlayground

# Create first file
New-Item hello.cpp
```

### üçé macOS

```bash
g++ --version
mkdir CppPlayground
cd CppPlayground
touch hello.cpp
```

Now open it in VS Code:

```powershell
code .
```

---

## **3.3 ‚Äî Your First C++ Program (Step-by-Step)**

File: `hello.cpp`

```cpp
#include <iostream>   // gives us std::cout
using namespace std;  // use std:: directly

int main() {
    cout << "Hello, Machine!" << endl;
    return 0;
}
```

### ‚öôÔ∏è Compile and Run

**Windows**

```powershell
g++ hello.cpp -o hello.exe
./hello.exe
```

**macOS**

```bash
g++ hello.cpp -o hello
./hello
```

Output:

```
Hello, Machine!
```

---

## **3.4 ‚Äî What Just Happened (Deep Dive)**

When you typed `g++ hello.cpp -o hello`:

1. **Preprocessing:** expands `#include` files (like iostream).
2. **Compilation:** converts C++ ‚Üí Assembly.
3. **Assembly:** translated to **object code (.o)**.
4. **Linking:** combines with libraries (like `libstdc++`) into an executable.

üß† You can actually peek at what the compiler does:

```bash
g++ -E hello.cpp > preprocessed.txt   # Step 1: Preprocessor output
g++ -S hello.cpp                      # Step 2: Assembly output
```

Open those files and _read them_. This is where C++ meets the CPU.

---

## **3.5 ‚Äî PowerShell vs Bash Integration**

Let‚Äôs integrate what you already know:

- In **PowerShell**, you can create your own helper:

  ```powershell
  function build-cpp {
      param([string]$file)
      g++ $file -o ([System.IO.Path]::GetFileNameWithoutExtension($file))
      Write-Host "Built $file!"
  }
  ```

  Then use:

  ```powershell
  build-cpp hello.cpp
  ./hello.exe
  ```

- In **Bash/macOS**, the equivalent:

  ```bash
  build-cpp() {
    g++ "$1" -o "${1%.*}"
    echo "Built $1!"
  }
  ```

  Then:

  ```bash
  build-cpp hello.cpp
  ./hello
  ```

You just wrote your first **custom build helper**.
Now you‚Äôre acting like a _real systems developer_.

---

## **3.6 ‚Äî Your First Git Integration**

We‚Äôll start using Git right here.

```bash
git init
git add hello.cpp
git commit -m "Initial commit - hello world"
```

Now modify your file to say:

```cpp
cout << "Hello, CNC World!" << endl;
```

Then:

```bash
git diff
git add .
git commit -m "Updated message for CNC World"
```

üí° Notice how Git now lets you safely experiment.

From here on, every coding session ‚Äî even small ‚Äî should start with a Git init.

---

## **3.7 ‚Äî Next Steps**

Now that you‚Äôve:

- Written and compiled code,
- Understood the pipeline (preprocess ‚Üí compile ‚Üí link),
- Integrated PowerShell and Bash helpers,
- And started using Git meaningfully,

We‚Äôll move into **Module 4: C++ Variables, Memory, and Data Representation** ‚Äî this is where you start learning how bits become logic, and how the compiler turns that logic into machine instructions.

---

Would you like me to continue straight into **Module 4 (Variables, Memory, and Data Representation)** next,
or pause here and go deeper into how the compiler translates C++ to assembly (e.g. exploring `objdump`, registers, and instruction flow)?
