Excellent ‚Äî now that we‚Äôve built a strong foundation on Git basics and plumbing, we‚Äôll move into **Module 02.3: Branching, Merging, and the Workflows That Run the World**.

This is the **core power of Git** ‚Äî where it stops being ‚Äúa way to save versions‚Äù and becomes a **distributed development system** that gives you godlike control over history, collaboration, and experimentation.

## üß© **Module 02.3 ‚Äì Branching, Merging, and Workflows**

---

### üéØ **Goals**

By the end of this module, you‚Äôll understand:

- What **branches** actually are (and how they‚Äôre stored internally).
- How to **merge**, **rebase**, and **resolve conflicts** safely.
- The differences between **Git workflows** (feature branching, Git Flow, trunk-based, etc.).
- When to use **fast-forward merges**, **squash merges**, and **rebasing**.
- How teams keep history clean while individuals experiment freely.

---

## üß† **Conceptual Overview**

### 1. What is a Branch in Git?

A **branch** is not a folder or a copy of files.
It‚Äôs just a **pointer** (a movable label) to a commit.

- A branch name (like `main` or `feature/login`) points to a **commit hash**.
- Each new commit moves that branch pointer forward.

Think of it like this:

```
main -> [C3] ‚Üê points to the latest commit on main
```

When you create a branch:

```bash
git branch feature-ui
```

Git simply creates a **new label** pointing to the same commit:

```
main -> [C3]
feature-ui -> [C3]
```

When you **checkout** that branch:

```bash
git checkout feature-ui
```

Git updates:

- The `HEAD` pointer ‚Üí now points to `feature-ui`.
- The working directory ‚Üí to match that commit‚Äôs snapshot.

Now, new commits move **feature-ui** forward, leaving **main** unchanged.

### 2. Branch Commands You‚Äôll Use Every Day

| Action            | Command                                      | What It Does               |
| ----------------- | -------------------------------------------- | -------------------------- |
| List branches     | `git branch`                                 | Shows all local branches   |
| Create new branch | `git branch <name>`                          | Adds a new pointer         |
| Switch branches   | `git checkout <name>` or `git switch <name>` | Moves HEAD                 |
| Create and switch | `git checkout -b <name>`                     | Shortcut: new + switch     |
| Delete branch     | `git branch -d <name>`                       | Removes local branch label |
| Rename branch     | `git branch -m old new`                      | Renames branch label       |

---

### 3. Merging Branches ‚Äì Combining Work

Let‚Äôs say:

```
main -> C3
feature-ui -> C4
```

You want to **merge `feature-ui` into `main`**.

#### Step 1: Checkout main

```bash
git checkout main
```

#### Step 2: Merge

```bash
git merge feature-ui
```

If there are no conflicts, Git performs a **fast-forward merge** (just moves the pointer):

```
main -> C4
```

If there were changes on both branches, Git creates a **merge commit** that joins histories:

```
      C3
     /  \
   C4    C5 (merge commit)
```

---

### 4. Resolving Merge Conflicts

When Git can‚Äôt automatically decide how to combine changes, it inserts **conflict markers** into your files:

```text
<<<<<<< HEAD
your code here
=======
their code there
>>>>>>> feature-ui
```

You manually edit, remove markers, and tell Git it‚Äôs resolved:

```bash
git add <file>
git commit
```

---

### 5. Rebasing ‚Äì An Alternative to Merge

Merging keeps both histories.

Rebasing **rewrites history** to make it look linear ‚Äî like your feature was always built on the latest main.

#### Example:

Before rebase:

```
main: C1 ‚Üí C2
feature: C1 ‚Üí F1 ‚Üí F2
```

After:

```bash
git checkout feature
git rebase main
```

Now Git _replays_ F1, F2 _on top of_ C2:

```
main: C1 ‚Üí C2 ‚Üí F1' ‚Üí F2'
```

‚ö†Ô∏è **Rebase rule**:

> Never rebase public branches that others might have pulled.

It‚Äôs safe to rebase your **local feature branches** before merging ‚Äî it keeps history clean.

---

### 6. Squash Merging ‚Äì Clean, Minimal History

When merging, you can collapse all your feature commits into a single one:

```bash
git merge --squash feature-ui
git commit -m "Add UI feature"
```

This creates one clean commit, ideal for tidy `main` history.

## üß© **Visual Summary**

```
Main Timeline:
C0 -- C1 -- C2 -- C3
         \
          F1 -- F2 (feature)
```

**Merge**:

```
C0 -- C1 -- C2 -- C3 -- M (merge)
         \             /
          F1 -- F2 ---/
```

**Rebase**:

```
C0 -- C1 -- C2 -- F1' -- F2'
```

## ‚öôÔ∏è **Advanced Workflows**

### üß™ Feature Branching (Common Today)

- Create a branch per feature.
- Merge (or squash merge) when tested.
- Keeps main stable, allows parallel work.

### üå≥ Git Flow (Classic)

- Branches: `main`, `develop`, `feature/*`, `release/*`, `hotfix/*`
- Great for large teams.
- Overhead for small teams or solo work.

### üöÄ Trunk-Based Development (Modern)

- Small, frequent commits directly on `main` (or short-lived branches).
- Works well with CI/CD pipelines.
- Promotes integration over isolation.

## üß© **Hands-On Practice (In Order)**

Let‚Äôs walk through this step-by-step (type along):

1Ô∏è‚É£ **Start a project**

```bash
mkdir git-branch-demo
cd git-branch-demo
git init
```

2Ô∏è‚É£ **Create main file**

```bash
echo "base version" > app.txt
git add .
git commit -m "Initial commit"
```

3Ô∏è‚É£ **Create a new branch**

```bash
git checkout -b feature-hello
echo "Hello world feature" >> app.txt
git add app.txt
git commit -m "Add hello feature"
```

4Ô∏è‚É£ **Switch back and make a change**

```bash
git checkout main
echo "Main branch update" >> app.txt
git add app.txt
git commit -m "Update main file"
```

5Ô∏è‚É£ **Merge feature**

```bash
git merge feature-hello
```

6Ô∏è‚É£ If conflict appears, open the file, resolve manually, then:

```bash
git add app.txt
git commit
```

## üß≠ **Mental Model Recap**

- Branch = movable pointer.
- Merge = join histories.
- Rebase = reapply commits elsewhere.
- Squash = flatten multiple commits.
- HEAD = where you are.
- `git log --graph --oneline --decorate` = visualize everything.
