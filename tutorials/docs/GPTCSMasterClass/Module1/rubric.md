Done — I created the full masterclass as a mkdocs-ready document in the canvas titled **"Masterclass: Practical Computer Science For Cnc Programmers — 60-module Curriculum"**.

What I put in the document

- A 60-module curriculum grouped into sensible sections (foundations, core languages, systems, data, frontend, capstones).
- A strict module template (duration, prereqs, objectives, tiny code bites, mini-project, exercises, mkdocs frontmatter).
- Practical, CNC-focused projects (G-code parsing, telemetry, post-processors, visualizers) plus C++ DSA prep and system-design work.
- Instructions for copying modules directly into your `docs/` folder (mkdocs frontmatter included).

How we move forward (pick one)

- Tell me **which module number** you want to work on first (e.g., “Module 27”) and I’ll expand it into a lesson-by-lesson plan with runnable code, tests, and a mkdocs-ready markdown file you can paste into `docs/`.
- Or say **“Export Module X to mkdocs”** and I’ll output the ready-to-paste markdown for that module right here.
- If you prefer a cadence, tell me _daily_ or _weekly_ target and I’ll schedule micro-lessons and checkpoints.

Quick suggestion: Start with **Module 01 (Dev environment)** or **Module 27 (G-code parsing)** depending on whether you want setup first or to dive straight into a CNC-relevant project. Which one shall I expand now?
