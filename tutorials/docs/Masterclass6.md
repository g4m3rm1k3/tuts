Of course. Let's get right into it.

The entire purpose of this section is repetition and reinforcement. We will follow the _exact same_ "vertical slice" pattern we used in Part 5. By doing this again, the workflow will start to move from conscious thought to muscle memory, which is the key to becoming a proficient developer.

---

### **Part 6: Feature Slice 2 - "Cancel Checkout" (Masterclass Edition)**

**The Goal:** A user who has a file checked out needs a way to unlock it, making it available for others. This is the logical opposite of our "Checkout" feature.

---

#### **ðŸš© Step 1: Backend - Designing the Endpoint**

We follow the same design process:

- **Action:** Changing the state of a file (unlocking it). This is a "write" operation.
- **HTTP Method:** It's an action that changes data, so we'll use **`POST`**.
- **URL:** The action applies to a specific file, so a clean RESTful URL is `/api/files/{filename}/cancel`.
- **Response:** We'll return the updated file object so the frontend can easily refresh its state.

---

#### **ðŸš© Step 2: Backend - Implementing the Endpoint**

Now, let's add the new endpoint to `backend/main.py`. This code will look very similar to our `checkout_file` function, which is the point\!

```python
# backend/main.py
# ... (all previous imports and code) ...

# --- NEW CANCEL CHECKOUT ENDPOINT ---
@app.post("/api/files/{filename}/cancel", response_model=File)
async def cancel_checkout(filename: str):
    """
    Cancels a checkout (unlocks) a file.
    """
    target_file = None
    for f in mock_db["files"]:
        if f["filename"] == filename:
            target_file = f
            break

    if not target_file:
        raise HTTPException(status_code=404, detail="File not found")

    # Business Logic: You can only cancel a checkout on a file that is currently locked.
    if target_file["status"] != "locked":
        raise HTTPException(status_code=409, detail="File is not currently locked")

    # In a real app with users, you would also check if the current user
    # is the one who locked the file before allowing the cancel.

    # Update the file's status in our mock DB
    target_file["status"] = "unlocked"
    target_file["locked_by"] = None
    target_file["locked_at"] = None

    return target_file


# --- MOUNT STATIC FILES ---
# ... (mount code remains at the end) ...
```

ðŸ”Ž **Deep Explanation**: The pattern is identical to the checkout logic. We find the resource, then we validate the state (the business rule). In this case, the rule is "you can only cancel a checkout if the file is actually locked." We use a **`409 Conflict`** again because trying to unlock an already-unlocked file conflicts with its current state. Finally, we perform the state change and return the result.

---

#### **ðŸš© Step 3: Frontend - Updating the UI Component**

We need to add a "Cancel Checkout" button that appears when a file is locked.

Open `frontend/js/components/FileCard.js` and add the new button logic.

```javascript
// frontend/js/components/FileCard.js

export function createFileCard(file) {
  const isLocked = file.status === "locked"; // We can simplify the original boolean

  return `
        <div class="bg-white p-4 rounded-lg shadow-md flex flex-col justify-between">
            <div>
                <h2 class="text-xl font-bold mb-2">${file.filename}</h2>
                <p class="text-gray-600 mb-4">${
                  file.description || "No description available."
                }</p>
            </div>
            <div class="text-sm text-gray-500 mb-4">
                <p>Revision: ${file.revision}</p>
                <p>Status: <span class="font-semibold">${file.status}</span></p>
                ${isLocked ? `<p>Locked by: ${file.locked_by}</p>` : ""}
                <p>Modified: ${new Date(file.modified_at).toLocaleString()}</p>
            </div>
            <div class="border-t pt-2 flex justify-end space-x-2">
                ${
                  isLocked
                    ? `
                    <button 
                        class="bg-yellow-500 hover:bg-yellow-700 text-white font-bold py-2 px-4 rounded cancel-btn"
                        data-filename="${file.filename}"
                    >
                        Cancel Checkout
                    </button>
                `
                    : `
                    <button 
                        class="bg-blue-500 hover:bg-blue-700 text-white font-bold py-2 px-4 rounded checkout-btn"
                        data-filename="${file.filename}"
                    >
                        Checkout
                    </button>
                `
                }
            </div>
        </div>
    `;
}
```

ðŸ”Ž **Deep Explanation**: We've expanded our ternary operator (`? :`). Now it says: "If the file `isLocked`, show the 'Cancel Checkout' button; otherwise (`:`), show the 'Checkout' button." This ensures the user is always presented with the correct, logical action for the file's current state.

---

#### **ðŸš© Step 4: Frontend - Updating the API Service**

Create the corresponding function in our service file to call the new endpoint.

Open `frontend/js/api/service.js` and add the `cancelCheckout` function.

```javascript
// frontend/js/api/service.js
// ... (fetchFiles and checkoutFile functions are here) ...

/**
 * Sends a request to cancel the checkout of a file.
 * @param {string} filename - The name of the file to cancel checkout for.
 * @returns {Promise<object>} A promise that resolves to the updated file object.
 */
export async function cancelCheckout(filename) {
  const response = await fetch(`/api/files/${filename}/cancel`, {
    method: "POST",
  });

  if (!response.ok) {
    const errorData = await response.json();
    throw new Error(errorData.detail || "Failed to cancel checkout");
  }

  return await response.json();
}
```

ðŸ”Ž **Deep Explanation**: This function is a mirror image of `checkoutFile`. The only things that change are the URL and the error message. This kind of predictable, consistent code structure makes an application much easier to read and maintain.

---

#### **ðŸš© Step 5: Frontend - Wiring the Event Listener**

Finally, we'll update our single event listener in `main.js` to handle clicks on the new button.

Open `frontend/js/main.js` and modify the listener.

```javascript
// frontend/js/main.js

// Import the new function
import { fetchFiles, checkoutFile, cancelCheckout } from "./api/service.js";
import { createFileCard } from "./components/FileCard.js";

const fileListContainer = document.getElementById("file-list-container");

// --- UPDATE THE EVENT LISTENER ---
fileListContainer.addEventListener("click", async (event) => {
  // Handle checkout button clicks
  if (event.target.matches(".checkout-btn")) {
    const filename = event.target.dataset.filename;
    try {
      await checkoutFile(filename);
      await initializeApp(); // Refresh UI
    } catch (error) {
      console.error("Checkout failed:", error);
      alert(`Error: ${error.message}`);
    }
  }

  // Handle cancel checkout button clicks
  if (event.target.matches(".cancel-btn")) {
    const filename = event.target.dataset.filename;
    try {
      await cancelCheckout(filename);
      await initializeApp(); // Refresh UI
    } catch (error) {
      console.error("Cancel checkout failed:", error);
      alert(`Error: ${error.message}`);
    }
  }
});

// ... (initializeApp function remains the same) ...

initializeApp();
```

ðŸ”Ž **Deep Explanation**: We simply add a new `if` block inside our delegated event listener. It looks for the `.cancel-btn` class and executes the corresponding logic. The internal pattern is identical: get the filename, call the service function in a `try...catch` block, and refresh the UI on success.

---

#### **ðŸš© Step 6: Testing the Full Workflow**

1.  Refresh your browser. You should see "Checkout" buttons.
2.  Click "Checkout" on a file. The page refreshes, the status changes to "locked," and the button now says "Cancel Checkout." .
3.  Click "Cancel Checkout." The page refreshes again, the status changes back to "unlocked," and the button reverts to "Checkout."

You have now successfully implemented a complete, reversible workflow.

#### **âœ… Recap**

This part was all about reinforcement. You've now implemented a second interactive feature by following the **exact same vertical slice pattern**:

**Backend Endpoint âž” Frontend Component âž” Frontend Service âž” Frontend Listener**

This blueprint is your key to building almost any feature in a web application. You've solidified your understanding of RESTful actions, state-based UI rendering, and event delegation.

#### **ðŸ“Œ What's Next:**

We've mastered simple `POST` requests. Now it's time to level up. In **Part 7**, we will tackle the **"Check-In" feature**. This is significantly more complex because it involves sending not just an action, but also dataâ€”a file upload and a text commentâ€”from the frontend to the backend.
