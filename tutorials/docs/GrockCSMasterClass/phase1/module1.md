# CS Mastery Masterclass: From Practical Hacker to Principled Architect

Welcome to your personalized **CS Mastery Masterclass**. Based on your background—decades in CNC machining, self-taught scripting wizardry in Python and JS, G-code macros that sparked your love for code, and that itch for deeper math and structure—I've designed this as a **project-driven odyssey**. We'll assume you're a "functional beginner": you hack outputs but wrestle with monoliths, folder chaos, and "why does this even work?" vibes. No fluff; every module builds intuition through **small, explained code bites** that assemble into runnable files, mini-projects, and real-world ties (like parsing G-code or optimizing tool paths).

## Core Philosophy

- **Depth Over Breadth, Then Expansion**: We start with rock-solid CS foundations (bits, logic, memory) to unlock why code _behaves_, not just _runs_. This feeds into structure (folders/files via principles like separation of concerns), then scales to architectures you can tinker on Windows/Mac.
- **Incremental & Hands-On**: Each module = 1-2 "days" (1-3 hours). Bite-sized code (no copy-paste walls—type/explain as you go). Build files step-by-step, test in your IDE (VS Code recommended). End with a mini-project or exercise.
- **Languages as Tools**: Python/JS core (your strengths), weave in C++ for DSA prep, bash/awk nods to your Linux roots, even assembly snippets for low-level thrills. Math woven in gently—visualize beauty via code (e.g., fractals from linear algebra).
- **Structure for MkDocs**: Each module is self-contained Markdown. Copy-paste into your repo (`docs/modules/`), run `mkdocs serve` to preview. Use admonitions for tips/exercises.
- **Pacing & Feedback**: Tackle 1 module/day. Return here for Q&A, tweaks, or "replay Module X with more math." We'll revisit topics (e.g., recursion in JS, then C++).
- **Tools Setup**: Install VS Code + extensions (Python, JS, C++, GitLens). Python 3.12+, Node.js 20+, GCC for C++ (via MinGW on Windows, Xcode on Mac). Git for versioning your progress.
- **50+ Modules Breakdown**: Grouped into **8 Phases** (phases = milestones with capstone projects). Total ~60 modules for "everything"—fundamentals to distributed systems, ethics to optimization. We'll evolve based on your feedback.

# Phase 1: Bits to Bytes – How Computers Think Like a Spindle

This phase demystifies the metal beneath the code. Like a CNC: bits are your raw stock, gates carve logic, memory holds the workpiece. We'll simulate on your machine—no hardware needed. Goal: By end, you'll see why a buffer overflow is like a tool crash.

## Module 1: The Binary Soul – From Numbers to Bits

**Time**: 1 hour. **Goals**: Grasp binary as the machine's native tongue. Link to math beauty (base-2 elegance). **Why?** Your G-code outputs decimals, but CPUs chew bits—understand this, and parsing floats in scripts clicks.

### Step 1: Why Binary? (5 min Read)

Computers aren't "smart"—they're voltage switches: on (1) or off (0). Binary packs info into 8-bit bytes (256 states, like 256 tool offsets). Math tie-in: Any decimal \( d \) converts via \( d = \sum b_i \cdot 2^i \) (powers of 2, exponential beauty—like compound interest for data).

Exercise: On paper, convert 42 (your age? tool #?) to binary. Hint: 32+8+2=42 → 101010.

### Step 2: Code Bite – Binary Converter in Python (15 min)

We'll build `binary.py` incrementally. Type each snippet, run `python binary.py`, see output. Explanations inline.

First, a function to convert decimal → binary string:

```python
# binary.py - Start empty, add line-by-line

def dec_to_bin(num):
    """Convert decimal to binary string. Why? Reveals bit patterns."""
    if num == 0:
        return '0'
    binary = ''
    while num > 0:
        binary = str(num % 2) + binary  # %2: remainder (bit), prepend for LSB first? No—wait, this builds MSB first actually.
        num = num // 2  # //: integer divide, shift right in bits.
    return binary

# Test it
print(dec_to_bin(42))  # Output: '101010' – See? 32(1)+16(0)+8(1)+4(0)+2(1)+1(0)
```

**Explanation**: Loop mimics division algorithm. `% 2` grabs the least significant bit (LSB), `// 2` shifts. Builds string backward—efficient O(log n), like log base-2 beauty. Run: Matches your paper? Tweak for 0-edge case.

Next bite: Binary → decimal, to close the loop.

```python
# Add to binary.py

def bin_to_dec(binary_str):
    """Binary string back to decimal. Math: Sum bits * 2^position."""
    decimal = 0
    for i, bit in enumerate(reversed(binary_str)):  # Reversed: LSB first for easy powers.
        decimal += int(bit) * (2 ** i)
    return decimal

# Test round-trip
bin_str = dec_to_bin(42)
print(bin_str, '->', bin_to_dec(bin_str))  # '101010' -> 42
```

**Explanation**: `enumerate(reversed())` iterates from right (LSB=2^0). `**` is exponent—pure math. Why reversed? Binary strings read MSB-left, but calc starts LSB. Run: 42 round-trips? Break it: Try 'invalid' like 'abc'—crashes? We'll fix in Module 2.

### Step 3: Mini-Project – G-Code Bit Inspector (20 min)

Tie to your world: G-codes use decimals, but machines store as bits. Build a snippet to inspect a "tool offset" (e.g., X=5.25) as bits.

Add to `binary.py`:

```python
# G-code sim: Decimal tool pos to bits
def inspect_tool_pos(pos):
    """Pretend pos is X-offset. Show binary for machine 'understanding'."""
    print(f"Tool X={pos}")
    bin_pos = dec_to_bin(int(pos * 100))  # Scale to 'units' like 525 for 5.25
    print(f"Binary (scaled): {bin_pos}")
    print(f"Bits needed: {len(bin_pos)}")  # Efficiency: How many bits for precision?

inspect_tool_pos(5.25)
```

**Run & Tinker**: Output? ~9 bits for 525. Math beauty: \( 2^9 = 512 \), close to 525—minimal bits = floor(log2(n))+1. Experiment: What if pos=42.0? Relate to awk scripts: Ever bit-masked in parsing?

### Step 4: Reflection & Teaser (5 min)

- **Cement**: Binary isn't "weird"—it's efficient packing, like compressing G-code runs.
- **Math Wish**: Powers of 2 feel like fractals? Next module: Bits → logic gates (AND like tool intersections).
- **Exercise**: Write a 1-line Python to count 1-bits in 42's binary (hint: `bin(42).count('1')`). Share output when you return.

**End Module 1**. File built: `binary.py` (save to Git). Questions? "More on floats?" Next: Module 2 – Logic Gates: Your First "Circuit."
