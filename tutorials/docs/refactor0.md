You've perfectly captured the professional mindset. Thinking about the project layout isn't just a preliminary step; it's a foundational stage of software architecture. Calling it **Stage 0** is spot on. It's the blueprint we create before we lay the first brick.

Let's dive into the "why" behind it, connecting this to the core CS and SDLC concepts you've studied.

### The Philosophy of Project Structure

At its core, a good project structure is all about one thing: **managing complexity**. A small script can live in a single file, but as an application grows, that becomes unmanageable. Imagine trying to build a house by piling all the lumber, pipes, wires, and furniture into one giant heap in the middle of the property. It would be impossible to build anything.

Instead, an architect creates a blueprint with distinct rooms: a kitchen for cooking, a bedroom for sleeping, and hallways to connect them. Each room has a clear purpose and contains only what's necessary for that purpose. A good project structure is the blueprint for your code.

This directly relates to a fundamental principle in computer science: **Separation of Concerns (SoC)**.

- **Separation of Concerns (SoC):** This principle states that an application should be divided into distinct sections, where each section addresses a separate "concern" or responsibility.
  - The **API layer's** concern is handling incoming web requests and sending back responses. It shouldn't know _how_ to talk to a Git repository.
  - The **Service layer's** concern is implementing the business logic (e.g., the steps for checking in a file). It shouldn't know about web requests.
  - The **Data layer's** concern is defining the shape of our data (the Pydantic models).

By enforcing this separation, we achieve two other critical CS goals: **High Cohesion** and **Low Coupling**.

- **High Cohesion:** Things that are related should be grouped together. All our Git-related logic will live in one place. This makes our code logical and intuitive.
- **Low Coupling:** Modules should be independent of each other. Our API layer will ask the "Git Service" to perform an action, but it won't care about the internal details of _how_ it's done. This means we could swap out the Git library for a different one in the service, and the API layer wouldn't need to change at all.

### Connection to the Software Development Life Cycle (SDLC)

Your SDLC course directly applies here. A proper structure impacts every single phase:

1. **Planning & Design:** Stage 0 _is_ the technical design phase. We're creating the architectural blueprint that the rest of the project will follow.
2. **Implementation:** With a clear structure, developers know exactly where to put new code and where to find existing code. On a team, this allows multiple people to work on different concerns (e.g., one on the frontend, one on the backend API, one on the database) simultaneously without conflict.
3. **Testing & Verification:** This is a huge one. It is nearly impossible to test a monolithic script effectively. By separating concerns into modules (like a `GitService`), we can write **unit tests** that test just that one piece of logic in isolation, which is faster and more reliable.
4. **Deployment:** A structured project is easier to package and deploy because the dependencies and entry points are clearly defined.
5. **Maintenance:** This is arguably the most important benefit. Over 80% of software cost is in maintenance. When a bug appears or a feature needs to be changed six months from now, a logical structure turns a multi-hour archeological dig through a giant file into a five-minute targeted fix. If there's a bug in how file locks are handled, you know to go straight to `lock_service.py`.

Now, let's turn this theory into practice.

### Stage 0: Architecting the Project Foundation

First, create a main folder for our entire project somewhere on your computer. Let's call it `mastercam-pdm`. Inside that folder, we'll start by creating the structure for our backend.

#### The Blueprint

Here is the directory structure we will create for the backend. The comments explain the "concern" of each part.

```
mastercam-pdm/
└── backend/
  ├── app/
  │  ├── __init__.py     # Makes the 'app' folder a Python package
  │  ├── main.py       # FastAPI app creation, middleware, and startup/shutdown logic
  │  ├── api/
  │  │  ├── __init__.py
  │  │  ├── dependencies.py  # Reusable dependencies (e.g., getting the current user)
  │  │  └── routers/    # Folder for all our API endpoint files
  │  │    ├── __init__.py
  │  │    ├── files.py  # Routes like /files/{filename}/checkout
  │  │    └── auth.py   # Routes like /login, /logout
  │  ├── core/
  │  │  ├── __init__.py
  │  │  ├── config.py     # Pydantic models for managing configuration
  │  │  └── security.py    # Password hashing, JWT token logic
  │  ├── models/
  │  │  ├── __init__.py
  │  │  └── schemas.py    # All Pydantic request/response models
  │  └── services/
  │    ├── __init__.py
  │    ├── git_service.py  # All Git and Git-LFS logic
  │    └── lock_service.py  # All file locking and metadata logic
  ├── run.py         # A simple script to start the web server
  └── requirements.txt    # A list of all Python libraries our project needs
```

#### Your Action Items

1. Create the top-level project folder: `mastercam-pdm`.
2. Inside it, create the `backend` folder.
3. Using your terminal or file explorer, create all the folders and subfolders shown in the blueprint inside the `backend` folder.
4. Create the empty files. The `__init__.py` files are important; they can be completely empty, but their presence tells Python that the folder is a "package" that can be imported from.

Let me know once you have this folder structure created, and we'll move on to **Stage 1** to start populating it with our refactored code.
