# Section 0: Setup & Professional Project Structure

## Introduction: Building on Solid Ground

Before writing a single line of logic code, professional developers set up their environment. This isn't busywork - it's the foundation that lets you:

- **Experiment safely** (version control)
- **Verify correctness** (automated testing)
- **Share your work** (proper documentation)
- **Manage complexity** (organized structure)
- **Collaborate** (even with yourself in 6 months)

Think of manufacturing: you don't start building on the factory floor before you have the floor, the tools, and safety systems in place.

---

## 0.1 Project Structure - Organizing for Success

### The Philosophy

**Question**: Why organize code into folders?

**Answer**: Same reason you organize a factory into departments:

- **Find things quickly**: "Where's the testing code?" → `tests/` folder
- **Understand purpose**: Folder names tell you what's inside
- **Scale safely**: Add new features without chaos
- **Collaborate**: Others (including future you) understand the layout

### Code Along: Create the Structure

Open your terminal and type these commands:

```bash
# Create the root directory
mkdir discrete-math-masterclass
cd discrete-math-masterclass

# Create all directories at once
mkdir -p notes
mkdir -p foundations/logic/tests
mkdir -p mini-projects/01-boolean-analyzer/tests
mkdir -p visualizations/truth-tables
mkdir -p capstone-project/tests
```

---

### Explanation: Understanding the Commands

**`mkdir`** = "make directory" (create a folder)

```bash
mkdir my-folder        # Creates one folder
```

**`-p` flag** = "create parent directories if needed"

```bash
mkdir -p foundations/logic/tests
```

This creates:

1. `foundations/` (if it doesn't exist)
2. `foundations/logic/` (if it doesn't exist)
3. `foundations/logic/tests/` (the final folder)

Without `-p`, if `foundations/` doesn't exist, you'd get an error!

**`cd`** = "change directory" (move into a folder)

```bash
cd discrete-math-masterclass    # Move into this folder
cd ..                           # Move up one level
cd foundations/logic            # Move down into nested folders
```

**Check your work:**

```bash
# On Mac/Linux:
ls -la

# On Windows:
dir
```

You should see all your folders!

---

### Understanding: What are `__init__.py` Files?

We need to create these in several places. First, let's understand what they do.

**What is `__init__.py`?**

An empty (or mostly empty) file that tells Python: "This folder is a Python package."

**Why do we need it?**

**Without `__init__.py`:**

```python
# This WON'T work:
from foundations.logic import operators
```

Python says: "I don't know what 'foundations.logic' is!"

**With `__init__.py`:**

```
foundations/
├── __init__.py          ← This makes 'foundations' a package
└── logic/
    ├── __init__.py      ← This makes 'logic' a package
    └── operators.py
```

```python
# Now this WORKS:
from foundations.logic import operators
```

**Real-world analogy:**

- `__init__.py` is like a "This is a Store" sign
- Without it, Python sees folders as just folders
- With it, Python sees packages it can import from

---

### Code Along: Create `__init__.py` Files

Create empty `__init__.py` in these locations:

```bash
# On Mac/Linux:
touch foundations/__init__.py
touch foundations/logic/__init__.py
touch foundations/logic/tests/__init__.py

# On Windows:
type nul > foundations/__init__.py
type nul > foundations/logic/__init__.py
type nul > foundations/logic/tests/__init__.py
```

Or just create them in your editor as empty files!

---

### Explanation: The `touch` and `type nul` Commands

**`touch filename`** (Mac/Linux)

- Creates an empty file if it doesn't exist
- Updates the timestamp if it does exist
- Quick way to create files from terminal

**`type nul > filename`** (Windows)

- Similar to touch on Windows
- `type nul` outputs nothing
- `>` redirects that nothing to a file
- Creates empty file

**Alternative**: Just use your code editor! Click "New File" and save it with the right name.

---

## 0.2 Python Virtual Environment - Isolation

### The Problem

Imagine you have two projects:

**Project A** needs:

- numpy version 1.20
- matplotlib version 2.0

**Project B** needs:

- numpy version 1.25
- matplotlib version 3.5

If you install these globally, they conflict! Only one version can be installed at a time.

### The Solution: Virtual Environments

A **virtual environment** is an isolated Python installation just for your project.

```
Your Computer
│
├── System Python 3.11
│   └── (system packages)
│
├── Project A Environment
│   ├── Python 3.11
│   ├── numpy 1.20
│   └── matplotlib 2.0
│
└── Project B Environment
    ├── Python 3.11
    ├── numpy 1.25
    └── matplotlib 3.5
```

Each project has its own dependencies - no conflicts!

---

### Code Along: Create Virtual Environment

In your project root (`discrete-math-masterclass/`):

```bash
# Create the virtual environment
python -m venv venv

# Activate it:

# On Windows:
venv\Scripts\activate

# On Mac/Linux:
source venv/bin/activate
```

**You should now see `(venv)` at the start of your terminal prompt!**

```
(venv) C:\Users\You\discrete-math-masterclass>
```

This means the virtual environment is active.

---

### Explanation: What Just Happened?

```bash
python -m venv venv
```

**Breaking it down:**

- `python` - Run Python
- `-m venv` - Run the `venv` module (virtual environment creator)
- `venv` - Name of the folder to create (you can call it anything, but "venv" is standard)

**What was created?**

```
venv/
├── Scripts/          # On Windows (or bin/ on Mac/Linux)
│   ├── activate      # Activation script
│   ├── python.exe    # Isolated Python
│   ├── pip.exe       # Isolated pip
│   └── ...
├── Lib/              # Where packages get installed
└── pyvenv.cfg        # Configuration
```

**When activated:**

- `python` command uses `venv/Scripts/python.exe` (not system Python)
- `pip install` installs packages into `venv/Lib/` (not globally)
- Your project is isolated!

---

### Explanation: Activating and Deactivating

**Activation script:**

```bash
source venv/bin/activate  # Mac/Linux
venv\Scripts\activate     # Windows
```

**What activation does:**

1. Modifies your PATH environment variable
2. Makes `python` point to `venv/Scripts/python.exe`
3. Shows `(venv)` in your prompt

**Deactivating:**

```bash
deactivate
```

This returns you to system Python.

**When to activate:**

- Every time you open a new terminal to work on this project
- Before running any Python code
- Before installing packages with pip

## 0.3 Dependencies - requirements.txt

### What Are Dependencies?

**Dependencies** are external libraries your project needs.

**Example:**

- You want to create graphs → need `matplotlib`
- You want to run tests → need `pytest`
- You want to work with graphs → need `networkx`

These aren't built into Python - you must install them.

---

### Code Along: Create requirements.txt

Create a file called `requirements.txt` in your project root:

```txt
# Testing Framework
pytest==7.4.3
pytest-cov==4.1.0

# Visualization
matplotlib==3.8.2
networkx==3.2.1

# Utilities
colorama==0.4.6
tabulate==0.9.0

# Type Checking
mypy==1.7.1
```

**Save this file.**

---

### Explanation: requirements.txt Format

```txt
pytest==7.4.3
```

**Format:** `package_name==version_number`

**Why specify versions?**

- **Reproducibility**: Anyone can install the exact same versions
- **Stability**: Newer versions might break your code
- **Documentation**: Shows what you tested with

**Version specifiers:**

```txt
pytest==7.4.3     # Exactly version 7.4.3
pytest>=7.4.0     # At least 7.4.0 (could be 7.5.0, 8.0.0, etc.)
pytest~=7.4.0     # Compatible release (7.4.0, 7.4.1, but not 7.5.0)
pytest            # Any version (not recommended!)
```

**Comments:**

```txt
# This is a comment explaining what follows
pytest==7.4.3
```

Lines starting with `#` are ignored - use them to organize!

---

### Code Along: Install Dependencies

With your virtual environment activated:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

**This will download and install all listed packages.**

You'll see output like:

```
Collecting pytest==7.4.3
  Downloading pytest-7.4.3-py3-none-any.whl
Installing collected packages: pytest, ...
Successfully installed pytest-7.4.3 ...
```

---

### Explanation: What is pip?

**pip** = "Pip Installs Packages"

- Python's package installer
- Downloads from PyPI (Python Package Index)
- Manages dependencies automatically

**Basic pip commands:**

```bash
pip install package_name           # Install latest version
pip install package_name==1.2.3    # Install specific version
pip install -r requirements.txt    # Install from file
pip list                           # Show installed packages
pip freeze                         # Show installed packages with versions
pip freeze > requirements.txt      # Save current packages to file
pip uninstall package_name         # Remove a package
```

**Where do packages come from?**

PyPI - Python Package Index ([pypi.org](https://pypi.org))

- Huge repository of open-source Python packages
- Anyone can publish (including you eventually!)
- pip downloads from here by default

**Further reading:**

- [pip Documentation](https://pip.pypa.io/en/stable/)
- [PyPI - The Python Package Index](https://pypi.org/)

---

### Understanding: What Each Package Does

Let's understand what we just installed:

**pytest (7.4.3):**

- Testing framework for Python
- Helps you write and run tests
- Verifies your code works correctly

**pytest-cov (4.1.0):**

- Plugin for pytest
- Measures "code coverage" (what % of your code is tested)
- Helps find untested code

**matplotlib (3.8.2):**

- Creates charts, graphs, plots
- Visualize data and algorithms
- We'll use this for truth tables, trees, etc.

**networkx (3.2.1):**

- Graph and network algorithms
- Create, manipulate, and study graphs
- Essential for Section 8-10

**colorama (0.4.6):**

- Colored terminal output
- Makes CLI output more readable
- Cross-platform (works on Windows too!)

**tabulate (0.9.0):**

- Create nice-looking tables in terminal
- Format truth tables beautifully
- Much better than manual formatting

**mypy (1.7.1):**

- Static type checker
- Catches type errors before running code
- Optional but professional

---

## 0.4 Git - Version Control

### Why Version Control?

**Without Git:**

```
my-project-v1.py
my-project-v2.py
my-project-v2-actually-working.py
my-project-final.py
my-project-final-FINAL.py
my-project-final-FINAL-for-real-this-time.py
```

**With Git:**

```
my-project.py  (one file, complete history stored)
```

---

### What is Git?

**Git** is a version control system that:

- Tracks every change you make
- Lets you go back to any previous version
- Enables experimentation without fear
- Allows collaboration
- Industry standard (GitHub, GitLab, etc.)

**Think of it like:**

- Save points in a video game
- Undo history in a document
- Time machine for your code

---

### Code Along: Initialize Git

In your project root:

```bash
git init
```

You'll see:

```
Initialized empty Git repository in .../discrete-math-masterclass/.git/
```

---

### Explanation: What Just Happened?

```bash
git init
```

**This created a hidden `.git/` folder:**

```
discrete-math-masterclass/
├── .git/              ← Hidden folder (Git's database)
│   ├── objects/       ← Your saved snapshots
│   ├── refs/          ← Branch pointers
│   ├── HEAD           ← Current branch
│   └── ...
├── foundations/
└── ...
```

**The `.git/` folder:**

- Contains the complete history
- You never directly edit this
- Git manages it automatically
- Delete it → lose all history (but your current files remain)

---

### Code Along: Create .gitignore

Create a file called `.gitignore` in your project root:

```gitignore
# Python
venv/
__pycache__/
*.pyc
*.pyo
*.pyd
.Python
*.so
*.egg
*.egg-info/
dist/
build/
*.whl

# Testing
.pytest_cache/
.coverage
htmlcov/
.tox/

# IDEs
.vscode/
.idea/
*.swp
*.swo
*~

# OS
.DS_Store
Thumbs.db
desktop.ini

# Project specific
*.log
.env
*.db
*.sqlite
```

**Save this file.**

---

### Explanation: What is .gitignore?

**.gitignore** tells Git which files to ignore (not track).

**Why ignore files?**

**1. Generated files:**

```gitignore
__pycache__/    # Python creates this automatically
*.pyc           # Compiled Python files
```

These are recreated automatically - no need to track them.

**2. Large files:**

```gitignore
venv/           # Thousands of files, huge
*.db            # Databases can be gigabytes
```

These make your repository slow and bloated.

**3. Secrets:**

```gitignore
.env            # API keys, passwords
*.key           # Private keys
```

Never commit secrets to Git! (Security risk)

**4. Personal settings:**

```gitignore
.vscode/        # Your editor settings
.DS_Store       # Mac system files
```

Everyone has different settings - don't share them.

**Pattern syntax:**

```gitignore
*.pyc           # Any file ending in .pyc
__pycache__/    # The __pycache__ folder anywhere
/build/         # Only /build/ at root (not subfolder build/)
logs/*.log      # .log files in logs/ folder
**/*.tmp        # .tmp files anywhere
```

---

### Code Along: Your First Commit

```bash
# Check status (what files are new/changed)
git status

# Add all files to staging area
git add .

# Check status again
git status

# Commit with a message
git commit -m "Initial project setup"

# View history
git log
```

**Type each command and observe the output!**

---

### Explanation: The Git Workflow

**Git has three areas:**

```
Working Directory  →  Staging Area  →  Repository
(your files)          (git add)        (git commit)
```

**1. Working Directory:**

- Your actual files on disk
- Edit freely here

**2. Staging Area (Index):**

- Files prepared for commit
- Like a "loading dock"
- `git add` moves files here

**3. Repository (.git folder):**

- Permanent history
- `git commit` saves staged files here
- Can't be changed (only added to)

**Commands:**

```bash
git status
```

Shows:

- Modified files (red)
- Staged files (green)
- Untracked files (red)

```bash
git add .
```

- `.` means "current directory and everything under it"
- Stages all changes
- Alternative: `git add filename` for specific files

```bash
git commit -m "message"
```

- `-m` = message
- Message should describe what changed
- Creates a permanent snapshot

```bash
git log
```

- Shows commit history
- Each commit has:
  - Unique hash (identifier)
  - Author and date
  - Message

**Good commit messages:**

```
✓ "Add truth table generator with tests"
✓ "Fix bug in AND operator"
✓ "Implement logical equivalence checker"

✗ "stuff"
✗ "changes"
✗ "asdf"
```

## 0.5 Project Configuration

### Code Along: Create pyproject.toml

Create `pyproject.toml` in your project root:

```toml
[project]
name = "discrete-math-masterclass"
version = "0.1.0"
description = "A comprehensive discrete math and software engineering course"
requires-python = ">=3.11"

[tool.pytest.ini_options]
# Where to find tests
testpaths = ["foundations", "mini-projects"]

# Test file patterns
python_files = "test_*.py"
python_classes = "Test*"
python_functions = "test_*"

# Show verbose output
addopts = [
    "-v",                    # Verbose
    "--strict-markers",      # Strict about test markers
    "--cov=foundations",     # Check code coverage
    "--cov-report=html",     # Generate HTML coverage report
    "--cov-report=term",     # Show coverage in terminal
]

[tool.mypy]
# Type checking settings
python_version = "3.11"
warn_return_any = true
warn_unused_configs = true
warn_redundant_casts = true
warn_unused_ignores = true
disallow_untyped_defs = true
disallow_any_generics = true
no_implicit_optional = true
strict_equality = true
```

---

### Explanation: pyproject.toml

**What is TOML?**

- TOML = Tom's Obvious, Minimal Language
- Configuration file format
- Easy to read and write
- Python's standard for project config

**Syntax:**

```toml
[section]
key = "value"
number = 42
boolean = true
list = ["item1", "item2"]
```

**Our sections:**

**`[project]`** - Project metadata

```toml
name = "discrete-math-masterclass"
version = "0.1.0"
```

Basic info about your project.

**`[tool.pytest.ini_options]`** - pytest configuration

```toml
testpaths = ["foundations", "mini-projects"]
```

Where to look for tests.

```toml
python_files = "test_*.py"
```

Only files starting with `test_` are test files.

```toml
addopts = ["-v", "--strict-markers"]
```

Default options when running pytest:

- `-v` = verbose (show each test)
- `--strict-markers` = error on undefined test markers

```toml
"--cov=foundations"
```

Measure code coverage for the `foundations` folder.

**`[tool.mypy]`** - Type checker configuration

```toml
disallow_untyped_defs = true
```

Require type hints on all functions (we'll learn this).

**Why configure?**

- Everyone on team uses same settings
- Don't need to remember command-line flags
- Consistent behavior

- Learned why organization matters for large projects

### 2. Virtual Environments

- Created isolated Python environment with `venv`
- Understand why: prevents dependency conflicts
- Command: `python -m venv venv`
- Activation: `source venv/bin/activate` (or `venv\Scripts\activate`)

### 3. Dependency Management

- Created `requirements.txt`
- Installed pytest, matplotlib, networkx, etc.
- Pinned versions for reproducibility
- Command: `pip install -r requirements.txt`

### 4. Version Control

- Initialized Git repository
- Created `.gitignore` for files to exclude
- Made first commit
- Understand the three areas: Working Directory → Staging → Repository

### 5. Configuration

- Created `pyproject.toml` for tool configuration
- Configured pytest and mypy
- Centralized settings for consistency

### 6. Documentation

- Created comprehensive README.md
- Used Markdown for formatting
- Documented setup process

## Key Commands

```bash
# Virtual environment
python -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate  # or venv\Scripts\activate

# Dependencies
pip install -r requirements.txt
pip freeze > requirements.txt

# Git
git status
git add .
git commit -m "message"
git log

# Testing (coming soon!)
pytest
pytest -v
pytest --cov
```

### Explanation: Note-Taking Strategy

**Why take notes?**
- **Reinforce learning**: Writing helps retention
- **Reference**: Look back when you forget
- **Track progress**: See how far you've come
- **Identify gaps**: What needs more study?

**Good note structure:**
1. **What I Learned** - Main concepts
2. **Key Commands** - Quick reference
3. **Questions** - Things to research more
4. **Next Steps** - Clear direction forward
5. **Resources** - Links for deeper learning

**Tips:**
- Write in your own words (not copy-paste)
- Include examples that helped you
- Note what confused you (to clarify later)
- Update notes as you understand better

## 0.8 Commit Your Setup

### Code Along: Save Your Progress

```bash
# Check what's changed
git status

# Add everything
git add .

# Commit
git commit -m "Complete Section 0: Professional project setup

- Created folder structure
- Set up virtual environment
- Installed dependencies
- Configured pytest and mypy
- Added comprehensive documentation"

# View your history
git log
````

---

### Explanation: Good Commit Messages

**Format:**

```
Short summary (50 chars or less)

Optional detailed explanation:
- What changed
- Why it changed
- Any important notes
```

**Example:**

```
Add truth table generator

- Implements generate_truth_table function
- Uses itertools.product for combinations
- Includes tests for 2 and 3 variable cases
- Fixes bug in previous version
```

**Why good messages matter:**

- Future you needs context
- Team members need to understand
- Makes history useful

## Section 0 Complete! �

### What You've Built

You now have a **professional** project structure:

✅ Organized folder hierarchy  
✅ Isolated Python environment  
✅ Managed dependencies  
✅ Version control with Git  
✅ Configured testing  
✅ Comprehensive documentation  
✅ Note-taking system

This is how **real software projects** are organized!

### Verification Checklist

Run these commands to verify everything works:

```bash
# 1. Check you're in virtual environment
# Should see (venv) in prompt

# 2. Check Python works
python --version
# Should show Python 3.11 or higher

# 3. Check packages installed
pip list
# Should show pytest, matplotlib, etc.

# 4. Check Git is working
git log
# Should show your commits

# 5. Check folder structure
# On Mac/Linux:
ls -la
# On Windows:
dir

# Should see: foundations/, mini-projects/, venv/, etc.
```

**All working? Great! You're ready for Section 1!**

## Next: Section 1 - Logic & Proofs

Now that we have a solid foundation, we'll start building our discrete math library from the ground up.

**In Section 1, we'll:**

1. Implement logical operators with proper type hints
2. Write comprehensive tests for each operator
3. Build a truth table generator
4. Create an equivalence checker
5. Make our first visualization
6. Start the Boolean Analyzer mini-project

**Should I begin Section 1?** We'll go piece by
