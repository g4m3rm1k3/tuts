Ah! I see exactly what you mean—you want **developer-focused teaching**, not just “here’s the code”. Let’s step back and do this **incrementally**, with deep explanations, small examples, and reasoning at each stage. I’ll teach you **why we do each step**, not just what to copy.

We’ll focus on **frontend RBAC and audit/log access**.

# Stage 6+ Frontend RBAC: Teaching Version

We’re going to build **role-based UI behavior**, where buttons and panels show only to allowed users, **step by step**.

---

## 1️⃣ Core Concept: Frontend RBAC

**Key idea:** The backend enforces permissions (security), the frontend **reflects these permissions in the UI** for usability.

* **CS perspective:** Frontend RBAC is **not a security measure**, it’s **UX enforcement**.
* **Developer mindset:** Think of role checks like “feature flags” tied to a user.
* **Goal:** Show, hide, enable, or disable elements based on user role.

**Analogy:**

> Admin = keys to all doors. User = only their own doors. Viewer = can only look through windows.

---

## 2️⃣ Step 1: Represent Permissions

Instead of just hardcoding “if admin show button”, we **map roles to actions**:

```javascript
const ROLE_PERMISSIONS = {
  admin: ["checkout", "checkin", "force_checkin", "view_audit"],
  user: ["checkout", "checkin"],
  viewer: ["view"]
};

function hasPermission(role, action) {
  return ROLE_PERMISSIONS[role]?.includes(action) || false;
}
```

**Teaching Notes:**

* `ROLE_PERMISSIONS` is like a **mini RBAC matrix**: row = role, column = allowed action.
* `hasPermission()` is a **reusable predicate**:

  * Avoids repeating “if role === 'admin'” everywhere.
  * Mirrors backend RBAC → keeps UI consistent.
* Always default `false` → principle of least privilege.

**Tip:** Think functionally—role + action → true/false.

---

## 3️⃣ Step 2: Conditional UI Rendering

Instead of just “render admin panel always”, we **ask the permission function**:

```javascript
function renderAdminPanel(role) {
  if (!hasPermission(role, "view_audit")) return;

  // Render admin panel...
}
```

**Teaching Notes:**

* **Step-by-step check:** first, “can this user see this panel?”
* Conditional rendering **prevents unnecessary DOM elements**, reduces clutter.
* **UX benefit:** Non-admins never see destructive actions → fewer mistakes.

**Mini Exercise:** Imagine a button that deletes files. Ask yourself:

* If a “viewer” clicks it, should it appear at all? ✅ No
* If a “user” clicks it? ✅ No
* Only “admin” sees it? ✅ Yes

This is **frontend RBAC reasoning**.

---

## 4️⃣ Step 3: Dynamic Button Handling

**Problem:** You have buttons like `checkout`, `checkin`, `force_checkin`. How to make each visible **based on role**?

**Solution:** map buttons to actions, iterate, apply display:

```javascript
const buttons = [
  { id: "checkout-btn", action: "checkout" },
  { id: "checkin-btn", action: "checkin" },
  { id: "force-checkin-btn", action: "force_checkin" }
];

buttons.forEach(btn => {
  const el = document.getElementById(btn.id);
  if (!el) return;
  el.style.display = hasPermission(role, btn.action) ? "inline-block" : "none";
});
```

**Teaching Notes:**

* Avoid repeating “if role === …” for every button.
* Treat **permissions as data**, not logic hardcoded.
* **UX principle:** Hide actions users cannot perform → clarity + reduces errors.

**Mini Exercise:** Think about a new role `manager`. Just add `"manager": ["checkout","checkin"]` to ROLE_PERMISSIONS. Buttons automatically update.

---

## 5️⃣ Step 4: Audit Modal Access

**Problem:** Only admins should view audit logs.

* Don’t rely on frontend alone for security (backend check required).
* Frontend check **avoids showing modal button** unnecessarily.

```javascript
if (hasPermission(role, "view_audit")) {
  document.getElementById("view-audit-logs-btn").addEventListener("click", openAuditModal);
}
```

**Teaching Notes:**

* Conditional **binding of events** = another layer of UX RBAC.
* **CS principle:** separation of concerns:

  * Backend = enforces **security**
  * Frontend = enforces **usability / convenience**
* **Developer mindset:** Avoid errors by preventing unauthorized events from firing at all.

---

## 6️⃣ Step 5: Filter Example

Filters in the audit modal should always reflect backend RBAC:

```javascript
const params = {};
if (filename) params.filename = filename;
if (user && hasPermission(role, "view_audit")) params.user = user;
```

**Teaching Notes:**

* Even if someone manipulates JS in browser, backend check will prevent access.
* Frontend RBAC → **improved UX**, backend RBAC → **true security**.

---

## ✅ Summary: How to Think About Frontend RBAC

1. **Map roles to actions**: One place for permissions → easy to maintain.
2. **Check before rendering**: Don’t create DOM elements users shouldn’t see.
3. **Bind events conditionally**: Prevent clicks on forbidden actions.
4. **Always pair with backend RBAC**: Frontend is convenience, not security.
5. **Use higher-order functions**: `hasPermission(role, action)` = reusable logic.
6. **Developer mindset**: Think **why this element should exist** before rendering.

If you want, the **next step** is a **live diagram** showing:

* **Role → frontend actions → backend enforcement → audit logging**

This is extremely helpful for teaching new developers **how frontend RBAC fits in the larger auth/audit system**.

Do you want me to make that diagram next?
