Got it ✅ — that’s an excellent move. A real masterclass doesn’t just explain concepts, it also points you toward the **best next resources** so you can dig deeper on your own. Let me show you how we can enrich **Part 4** with resource links at each step. I’ll add inline references plus a “Further Study” section at the end.

# **Part 4: The Great Connection - Frontend Meets Backend (Masterclass Edition with Resources)**

---

### 🚩 Step 1: The Tool - The `fetch` API

We used `fetch` for network requests.

🔎 **Deeper Dive Resources**

- MDN Docs (official browser reference): [Using Fetch](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Fetch_API/Using_Fetch)
- Tutorial: [JavaScript Async/Await](https://javascript.info/async-await)

---

### 🚩 Step 2: Organizing Our Code - Services and Components

Professional structuring into **services** and **components** keeps things scalable.

🔎 **Deeper Dive Resources**

- Clean JavaScript architecture ideas: [Bulletproof React Patterns (transferable to vanilla JS)](https://github.com/alan2207/bulletproof-react)
- JS modules explained: [MDN – Import/Export](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Guide/Modules)

---

### 🚩 Step 3: Building the API Service

We wrote `fetchFiles()` in a dedicated API service.

🔎 **Deeper Dive Resources**

- FastAPI API building: [FastAPI Tutorial – Path Operations](https://fastapi.tiangolo.com/tutorial/path-params/)
- REST API design: [Microsoft REST API Guidelines](https://github.com/microsoft/api-guidelines)

---

### 🚩 Step 4: Building the UI Component

We created `FileCard` with template literals.

🔎 **Deeper Dive Resources**

- JS Template Literals: [MDN Docs](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Template_literals)
- DOM manipulation: [JavaScript.info – Document](https://javascript.info/document)

---

### 🚩 Step 5: Orchestrating in `main.js`

We handled errors with `try/catch` and orchestrated the UI.

🔎 **Deeper Dive Resources**

- Error handling patterns: [MDN – try/catch](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Statements/try...catch)

### 📚 **Further Study – Part 4 Resource Pack**

If you want to go beyond the tutorial, here’s a curated study path:

1. **Frontend Networking**:

   - MDN Fetch + Async/Await → Master HTTP requests.

2. **Backend API Design**:

   - FastAPI docs + REST API design guides.

3. **UI/UX Foundations**:

   - JavaScript DOM + Tailwind docs.

4. **Core Web Concepts**:

   - MDN HTTP + CORS → understand how browsers and servers talk.

5. **Scaling Your Knowledge**:

   - Learn GraphQL & WebSockets as modern API alternatives.
   - Learn Auth (JWT, sessions) since every real-world app needs it.

Would you like me to **retroactively add these resource sections to Parts 1–3** as well, so your whole “Masterclass” doc builds into a self-contained guide with reading paths? That way, each part ends with a “Resource Pack” like this.
