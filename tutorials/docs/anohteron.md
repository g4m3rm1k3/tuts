Of course, I'd be happy to help with that. It sounds like you've found some excellent technical details that are just presented in a dense or confusing way. That's very common with raw technical notes.

Let's work together to refine, reorganize, and expand that information into a clear, structured, and deeply educational part of our tutorial. I'll integrate all the valuable insights from the document you provided into the established format for Stage 0.

Here is the complete, unified Stage 0 that incorporates those deeper dives.

# Stage 0: The Professional Development Environment (Expanded & Unified)

## Introduction: The Goal of This Stage

Before we can build a sophisticated web application, we must first prepare our workspace. Think of this like a carpenter setting up their workshop—you need the right tools, you need to understand what each tool does, and you need to organize them for efficient work. Getting this stage right saves countless hours of frustration later.

By the end of this stage, you will have:

- A working Python and JavaScript environment with professional package management.
- A code editor (VS Code) configured for efficient development.
- Essential command-line skills for navigating your system and running programs.
- Git installed and configured for version control.
- A secure connection to GitLab for remote collaboration and backup.

---

### **🧠 Foundational Concepts: A Deeper Look**

- **Time Investment:** 2-4 hours. Do not rush this. A stable and well-understood environment is the foundation for everything that follows.
- **Historical Insight**: The core concepts of a developer's environment, like the command line and the `PATH` variable, date back to the Multics and Unix operating systems of the 1960s and 70s. While modern tools like Docker can automate this setup, understanding these fundamentals is crucial for effective troubleshooting.
- **Key Concept: Reproducibility**. A primary goal of this stage is to create a **reproducible environment**. This means that another developer (or a production server) can replicate your setup precisely, which is the first step in eliminating "it works on my machine" bugs.

---

## 0.1: Understanding Your Operating System (OS)

Your OS determines _how_ you'll install tools and which commands you'll use.

| Feature         | Windows (PowerShell)                     | macOS/Linux (Bash/Zsh)                   | Why It Matters                                                                                                              |
| :-------------- | :--------------------------------------- | :--------------------------------------- | :-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Paths**       | Backslashes (`\`), Drive Letters (`C:\`) | Forward slashes (`/`), Root (`/`)        | Code that hardcodes path separators will break on other systems.                                                            |
| **List Dir**    | `dir` or `ls` (PowerShell alias)         | `ls`                                     | Different commands for the same basic operation.                                                                            |
| **Permissions** | Less strict for user files               | Often requires `sudo` for system changes | Never use `sudo pip install`. This is a major security risk and can break system packages. Always use virtual environments. |

#### 🏋️ Practice Exercise: Cross-OS Path Handling

Python's `pathlib` module is the modern, professional way to handle filesystem paths. It automatically uses the correct separators for your OS. Create a file `path_test.py` to see it in action.

```python
# path_test.py
from pathlib import Path

# Create a Path object. This is an object, not just a string.
repo_path = Path("my_project") / "src"

# The '/' operator automatically joins path components with the correct separator.
print(f"Path object: {repo_path}")
# On Windows, this will print: my_project\src
# On macOS/Linux, it prints: my_project/src

# Path objects have useful methods and properties
print(f"Absolute path: {repo_path.resolve()}")
print(f"Does it exist? {repo_path.exists()}")
```

Run `python path_test.py`. This demonstrates why using `pathlib` is a best practice for writing code that works everywhere.

---

## 0.2: Installing Python

### The Python Interpreter and Bytecode

When you write Python code, you're writing human-readable text. Before the computer can run it, the Python **interpreter** performs a two-step process:

1.  **Compilation**: It compiles your source code into a lower-level, platform-independent format called **bytecode**.
2.  **Interpretation**: The **Python Virtual Machine (PVM)** then executes this bytecode.

This hybrid approach makes Python easier to use than fully compiled languages like C++ while still being faster than purely interpreted languages.

#### 🔬 Deeper Dive: Viewing Python Bytecode

You can see the bytecode for yourself using Python's built-in `dis` (disassembler) module. Add this to a new file, `bytecode_test.py`:

```python
# bytecode_test.py
import dis

def add(x, y):
    return x + y

# The dis.dis() function prints the bytecode for the 'add' function.
dis.dis(add)
```

Run `python bytecode_test.py`. The output will look something like this:

```
  4           0 RESUME                   0

  5           2 LOAD_FAST                0 (x)
              4 LOAD_FAST                1 (y)
              6 BINARY_OP                0 (+)
             10 RETURN_VALUE
```

These are the low-level instructions the PVM actually executes. `LOAD_FAST` pushes your variables onto a stack, `BINARY_OP` performs the addition, and `RETURN_VALUE` returns the result.

### Installation Steps & `pip`

Follow the instructions in the base tutorial to install Python for your OS. The most critical step for **Windows** is checking **"Add Python to PATH"** during installation.

When you install Python, you also get `pip` (Pip Installs Packages), the official package manager. It's like an app store for Python code libraries.

Verify your `pip` installation:

```bash
pip --version
# On Windows, you might need pip.exe --version
# On macOS/Linux, you might need pip3 --version
```

---

## 0.3: The Command Line & The `PATH` Variable

The terminal is a developer's most essential tool. Mastering a few basic commands is non-negotiable.

- `pwd` (Print Working Directory): Shows your current folder location.
- `ls` (List): Shows the contents of the current folder. (On Windows, `dir`).
- `cd` (Change Directory): Moves you to a different folder. (e.g., `cd Documents`).
- `mkdir` (Make Directory): Creates a new folder. (e.g., `mkdir my-project`).

### The `PATH` Environment Variable

When you type a command like `python` or `pip`, how does your shell know where to find the program to run? It searches a list of directories defined in an environment variable called `PATH`.

#### 🔬 Deeper Dive: Visualizing Your `PATH`

You can write a simple Python script to see the contents of your `PATH` in a clean, readable way.

```python
# path_viewer.py
import os

# Get the PATH variable from the environment
path_variable = os.environ.get("PATH", "")

# Split the PATH string into a list of individual directories
# The separator is ':' on macOS/Linux and ';' on Windows
directories = path_variable.split(os.pathsep)

print("Your system's PATH includes:")
for i, directory in enumerate(directories):
    print(f"{i+1}: {directory}")
```

Run `python path_viewer.py`. When you type a command, your shell looks for an executable file with that name in each of these directories, in order. This is why checking **"Add Python to PATH"** on Windows is so important—it adds Python's installation directory to this list.

---

## 0.4: Virtual Environments (`venv`)

### The Problem: Dependency Conflicts

Imagine Project A needs version 1.0 of a library, but Project B needs version 2.0. If you install them globally on your system, one project will inevitably break.

### The Solution: Isolation

A **virtual environment** is an isolated, self-contained directory that holds a specific version of Python and all the packages for a single project.

**Create a virtual environment for our project:**

```bash
# In your pdm-tutorial directory
python -m venv venv
```

This creates a `venv` folder containing a copy of the Python interpreter and a place to install packages.

**Activate the environment:**

- **Windows (PowerShell):** `.\venv\Scripts\Activate.ps1`
- **macOS/Linux:** `source venv/bin/activate`

Your terminal prompt will now be prefixed with `(venv)`, indicating the environment is active. Any packages you install now will go into the `venv` folder, not your global system.

#### 🔬 Deeper Dive: What `venv` Actually Does

When you activate a `venv`, it modifies your shell's environment. The primary change is to your `PATH`. Let's prove it with a Python script that inspects `sys.path`, which is Python's own search path for modules.

```python
# sys_path_test.py
import sys

for path in sys.path:
    print(path)
```

1.  **Deactivate** your environment first (`deactivate`).
2.  Run `python sys_path_test.py`. You'll see paths pointing to your global Python installation.
3.  **Activate** your environment (`source venv/bin/activate` or `.\venv\Scripts\Activate.ps1`).
4.  Run `python sys_path_test.py` again.

You will see that the **first paths** in the list now point to your project's `venv/lib/site-packages` directory. This is how Python finds your project-specific packages before looking at the global ones.

### `requirements.txt` and Dependency Trees

When working in an active virtual environment, you should always document your dependencies.

```bash
# (with venv active)
# Install a package
pip install fastapi

# Freeze your dependencies into a file
pip freeze > requirements.txt
```

The `requirements.txt` file is a manifest of your project's exact dependencies. This file should be committed to Git.

To visualize how your packages depend on each other, you can use `pipdeptree`.

```bash
pip install pipdeptree
pipdeptree
```

This will show you a tree view, revealing that installing one package like `fastapi` often brings in many other "dependency" packages.

---

## 0.5: Version Control with Git & GitLab

### Git's Three-Stage Architecture

It helps to think of Git as having three "areas":

1.  **Working Directory**: Your actual files on disk. This is your "workbench" where things can be messy.
2.  **Staging Area (Index)**: A "snapshot" of the changes you want to include in your _next_ commit. This is like arranging items on a photo table before taking the picture. You `git add` files to move them here.
3.  **Repository (`.git` directory)**: The permanent, immutable history of all your commits. This is the "photo album." You `git commit` to save the staged snapshot here forever.

### The Basic Workflow

Follow the base tutorial's steps for `git init`, `git config`, `git add`, and `git commit`.

#### 🔬 Deeper Dive: The Commit Hash (SHA-1)

When you run `git log`, you see a long string of characters like `a3f5c9b...`. This is a **SHA-1 hash**. It's a unique, 40-character fingerprint of the commit's contents.

Git calculates it by hashing the commit's metadata (the tree it points to, parent commit hash, author, committer, and commit message).

```
# Conceptual content of a commit object
tree 29ff16c...
parent 482783...
author Your Name <email> 1664841600 -0400
committer Your Name <email> 1664841600 -0400

Initial commit: Add README
```

Hashing this content produces the unique commit ID. Because the parent's hash is part of the content, it creates a secure, tamper-proof chain of history. If anyone tried to alter a past commit, its hash would change, which would in turn change the hash of every subsequent commit, making the tampering immediately obvious.

### Connecting to GitLab

Follow the base tutorial to generate an SSH key, add it to GitLab, create a remote repository, and `git push` your initial commit. Using SSH keys is the professional standard as it's more secure and convenient than using passwords.

## Stage 0 Complete - A Professional Foundation

Congratulations\! You've set up a complete, professional development environment. Before moving on, ensure you have completed the verification checklist from the original tutorial. You now have a deep understanding of not just _what_ the tools do, but _why_ they are designed the way they are.

You are now ready to build your first backend API in **Stage 1**.

Excellent feedback. Thank you for being so specific—it's incredibly helpful. You're absolutely right to ask for more. A good tutorial doesn't just show you the "what"; it explains the "why" and gives you avenues to explore further.

I will absolutely incorporate these requests going forward:

1.  **More Resource Links**: I'll add links to official documentation, influential articles, RFCs (the technical standards for the internet), and other high-quality resources so you can dig deeper.
2.  **More CS/Security Depth**: I'll make sure to connect our work to underlying computer science principles. Since you're studying security, I'll add extra details on topics like hashing, cryptography, and secure design patterns as they come up.
3.  **Complete, Commented Code**: You are correct; the code should be built up incrementally and clearly. I will ensure every new block of code is fully commented, and I will provide complete snapshots of the files at the end of each stage so you can be confident your code matches.

I appreciate you pushing for more depth. That's the mark of a great learner.

Let's apply this new approach and dive into **Stage 1**.

# Stage 1: First Backend - FastAPI Hello World (Expanded & Unified)

## Introduction: The Goal of This Stage

You're about to write your first web server. Think of it as the "digital brain" of your application—it handles logic, processes data, and communicates with clients. This stage is your foundation in backend development.

By the end, you'll have a fully functional API, and you'll understand not just the code, but the fundamental computer science and networking principles that make it work.

---

### **🧠 Foundational Concepts: A Deeper Look**

- **Historical Insight**: Modern web frameworks like FastAPI stand on the shoulders of giants. The journey began with simple **CGI scripts** in the 90s, which were slow and inefficient. This led to standards like **WSGI (Web Server Gateway Interface)** in 2003, which powered synchronous Python frameworks like Flask and Django. The need for higher performance brought about **ASGI (Asynchronous Server Gateway Interface)**, enabling the `async`/`await` capabilities that give FastAPI its speed.
- **Further Reading**:
  - The ASGI Specification: [https://asgi.readthedocs.io/en/latest/](https://asgi.readthedocs.io/en/latest/)

---

## 1.1: What is a Web Server?

A web server is a program that listens for incoming network requests over the **HTTP protocol** and sends back responses. This is known as the **client-server model**.

- **Client**: The requester (e.g., your web browser, a mobile app).
- **Server**: The listener and responder (our FastAPI application).

### HTTP: The Language of the Web

HTTP (HyperText Transfer Protocol) is the language clients and servers use to speak to each other. It's a simple, text-based protocol.

#### An HTTP Request Breakdown

```http
GET /api/files HTTP/1.1
Host: localhost:8000
User-Agent: curl/8.4.0
Accept: application/json
```

- `GET /api/files HTTP/1.1`: The **Request Line**. It contains the HTTP **method** (`GET`), the requested **resource path** (`/api/files`), and the protocol version.

- `Host: localhost:8000`: A **Header**. Headers provide metadata about the request. The `Host` header is mandatory in HTTP/1.1.

- **Blank Line**: A blank line separates the headers from the (optional) request body.

- **Further Reading**:

  - Anatomy of an HTTP Transaction (MDN): [https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Messages](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Messages)

### Why FastAPI?

We're choosing FastAPI for three key reasons that align with modern best practices:

1.  **Performance**: It's one of the fastest Python frameworks available, thanks to its `async` nature and use of cutting-edge libraries.
2.  **Developer Experience**: Its automatic, interactive API documentation (`/docs`) and powerful data validation make development faster and less error-prone.
3.  **Modern Python**: It leverages modern Python features like type hints to provide a robust and maintainable structure.

---

## 1.2: Setting Up and Installing Dependencies

### Activate Your Virtual Environment

Always work inside your virtual environment. From your `pdm-tutorial` directory:

- **Windows (PowerShell):** `.\venv\Scripts\Activate.ps1`
- **macOS/Linux:** `source venv/bin/activate`

### Install FastAPI

```bash
pip install "fastapi[all]"
```

The `[all]` extra conveniently installs FastAPI along with `uvicorn` (our web server) and other useful dependencies.

### Document Your Dependencies

This is a crucial professional habit. The `requirements.txt` file is the official manifest of your project's dependencies.

```bash
pip freeze > requirements.txt
```

Commit this file to Git. Now, anyone can recreate your exact environment with `pip install -r requirements.txt`.

---

## 1.3: Your First FastAPI Application

Let's write the code. All our backend code will live in a `backend` directory.

### Create the File

If you haven't already, create the directory and file:

```bash
# In your pdm-tutorial root directory
mkdir backend
cd backend
touch main.py  # On Windows PowerShell: New-Item -ItemType File -Name main.py
```

### The "Hello World" Server

Open `backend/main.py` and add the following code.

```python
# backend/main.py

# --- 1. Imports ---
# We import the FastAPI class, which is the core of the framework.
from fastapi import FastAPI

# --- 2. Application Instance ---
# We create an instance of the FastAPI class. This `app` object is our main
# point of interaction with the framework. We pass metadata that will be
# used for the automatic API documentation.
app = FastAPI(
    title="PDM Backend API",
    description="The API for the Parts Data Management system.",
    version="0.1.0",
)

# --- 3. Route Definition ---
# This is a "path operation decorator".
# @app:  Tells it to use our FastAPI instance.
# .get:  Specifies that this function responds to HTTP GET methods.
# ("/"): The URL path this function will handle.
@app.get("/")
def read_root():
    """
    This function is a "path operation function" or "endpoint".
    When a GET request is made to "/", FastAPI will call this function.
    """
    # FastAPI automatically converts this Python dictionary into a JSON
    # response and sets the correct Content-Type header.
    return {"message": "Hello from the PDM Backend!"}
```

#### 🔬 Deeper Dive: Decorators, Closures, and Higher-Order Functions

The `@app.get("/")` syntax is a Python **decorator**. From a computer science perspective, a decorator is a **higher-order function**—a function that takes another function as an argument and returns a new, modified function.

When you write `@app.get("/")`, Python is doing this behind the scenes:

```python
# This is a simplified view of what FastAPI does
def get(path):
    def decorator(func):
        # This inner function 'decorator' has access to 'path' from its
        # parent scope. This is called a 'closure'.
        print(f"Registering function {func.__name__} for path {path}")
        # In reality, FastAPI adds 'func' to a routing table here.
        return func # Return the original function, now registered
    return decorator

# So, @get("/") is the same as:
# read_root = get("/")(read_root)
```

This is a powerful concept from functional programming that allows you to add functionality (like routing, authentication, or logging) to functions without modifying their internal code.

---

## 1.4: Running the Server

Navigate your terminal into the `backend` directory.

```bash
# In the `backend` directory
uvicorn main:app --reload --host 127.0.0.1
```

- `main:app`: In the file `main.py`, find the `FastAPI` instance named `app`.
- `--reload`: A development server flag that watches for code changes and automatically restarts.
- `--host 127.0.0.1`: Binds the server to your local machine only. This is generally safer for development, especially on Windows where firewalls might block the default.

Your server is now running\! You can test it by visiting `http://127.0.0.1:8000` in your browser.

---

## 1.5: Adding More Endpoints

Let's expand our API. We'll add endpoints to get a list of files, and to get details for a specific file.

**Add the following code to `backend/main.py`:**

```python
# ADD this to main.py (along with `from typing import List`)

# --- Pydantic Models for Data Shapes ---
# We'll use this later, but it's good practice to define data schemas.
# from pydantic import BaseModel
# class File(BaseModel):
#     name: str
#     status: str

# --- API Endpoints ---

@app.get("/api/files", response_model=List[dict])
def get_files():
    """This endpoint returns a hardcoded list of files."""
    # In a real app, this data would come from a database or the filesystem (Stage 3).
    files = [
        {"name": "PN1001_OP1.mcam", "status": "available"},
        {"name": "PN1002_OP1.mcam", "status": "checked_out"},
        {"name": "PN1003_OP1.mcam", "status": "available"}
    ]
    return files

@app.get("/api/files/{filename}")
def get_file_detail(filename: str):
    """
    This endpoint uses a Path Parameter to get a specific file.
    The value of {filename} in the URL is passed as an argument to the function.
    """
    # Simulate checking if the file exists
    if filename not in ["PN1001_OP1.mcam", "PN1002_OP1.mcam"]:
        # If not found, raise a 404 error. FastAPI handles this gracefully.
        raise HTTPException(status_code=404, detail="File not found.")

    return {
        "requested_filename": filename,
        "status": "available", # Hardcoded for now
        "size_mb": 1.2
    }
```

- **Path Parameter (`{filename}`):** This allows for dynamic URLs. FastAPI uses the type hint (`filename: str`) to automatically validate that the path segment is a string. If you defined it as `item_id: int`, FastAPI would validate that it's an integer and return a `422 Unprocessable Entity` error if it's not.

Save the file and test your new endpoints:

- `curl http://127.0.0.1:8000/api/files`
- `curl http://127.0.0.1:8000/api/files/PN1001_OP1.mcam`
- `curl http://127.0.0.1:8000/api/files/FAKE_FILE.mcam` (This should return a 404 error).

---

## 1.6: Interactive API Documentation

This is where FastAPI shines. With zero extra effort, you have a fully interactive API documentation site.

- **Swagger UI**: Visit `http://127.0.0.1:8000/docs`
- **ReDoc**: Visit `http://127.0.0.1:8000/redoc`

Click on one of the endpoints in the `/docs` page, press "Try it out," and "Execute." You can test your API directly from the browser. This documentation is automatically generated from your code's paths, parameters, and type hints.

- **Further Reading**:
  - OpenAPI Specification: [https://swagger.io/specification/](https://swagger.io/specification/)

---

## Stage 1 Complete: Code Snapshot

Congratulations\! You've built a multi-endpoint API. Here is the complete code for `backend/main.py` at the end of this stage.

```python
# backend/main.py

from fastapi import FastAPI, HTTPException
from typing import List

# Application Instance
app = FastAPI(
    title="PDM Backend API",
    description="The API for the Parts Data Management system.",
    version="0.1.0",
)

# Root Endpoint
@app.get("/")
def read_root():
    return {"message": "Hello from the PDM Backend!"}

# API Endpoints
@app.get("/api/files", response_model=List[dict])
def get_files():
    files = [
        {"name": "PN1001_OP1.mcam", "status": "available"},
        {"name": "PN1002_OP1.mcam", "status": "checked_out"},
        {"name": "PN1003_OP1.mcam", "status": "available"}
    ]
    return files

@app.get("/api/files/{filename}")
def get_file_detail(filename: str):
    if filename not in ["PN1001_OP1.mcam", "PN1002_OP1.mcam"]:
        raise HTTPException(status_code=404, detail="File not found.")

    return {
        "requested_filename": filename,
        "status": "available",
        "size_mb": 1.2
    }
```

### What's Next?

In **Stage 2**, we will build the frontend—a user interface with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript that will consume the API you just built.

You've made a great point, and you're right. That's excellent feedback on the tutorial's flow.

Introducing the entire REST philosophy right at the beginning of Stage 1 can be a bit much when you're just focused on getting your first server endpoint running. It's better to build the practical pieces first and then step back to see how they fit into the bigger design pattern.

Let's adjust our plan: We'll move the deep dive on REST to the **end of Stage 1**, where it can serve as a capstone concept that ties together all the different endpoints (`GET`, `POST`, path parameters, etc.) you've built. That way, the theory will connect directly to the code you've already written.

With that in mind, let's move on and build the frontend. Here is the complete, expanded Stage 2.

---

# Stage 2: First Frontend - HTML, CSS, & JavaScript Basics (Expanded & Unified)

## Introduction: The Goal of This Stage

Our backend API is like a restaurant kitchen, ready to serve up data. Now, we need to build the "dining room"—the user interface (UI) where users can see that data and interact with it. This stage is all about the frontend trinity: **HTML** for structure, **CSS** for style, and **JavaScript** for behavior.

By the end of this stage, you will:

- Serve static files (HTML, CSS, JS) from your FastAPI backend.
- Structure your application's UI with semantic HTML.
- Apply a professional design with CSS, understanding core concepts like the box model and specificity.
- Use JavaScript to dynamically fetch data from your API and update the page without a full reload.
- Handle user interactions like button clicks and form submissions.

---

### **🧠 Foundational Concepts: A Deeper Look**

- **Time Investment:** 4-6 hours.
- **Historical Insight**: The modern web is built on three core technologies. **HTML** (Tim Berners-Lee, 1990) gave the web its structure. **CSS** (Håkon Wium Lie, 1996) was created to separate that structure from its presentation. **JavaScript** (Brendan Eich, 1995) was famously created in just 10 days to add interactivity. The ability for JavaScript to fetch data in the background, a technique called **AJAX** (popularized by Gmail in 2004), is what made modern, responsive web applications possible.
- **Key Concept - SPA vs. MPA**:
  - **MPA (Multi-Page Application)**: The traditional web model. Clicking a link downloads a completely new HTML page from the server.
  - **SPA (Single-Page Application)**: The modern model we're building. The server sends a single HTML page, and JavaScript takes over, dynamically fetching data and rewriting parts of the page as needed. This feels much faster and more like a desktop application.

---

## 2.1: Serving Static Files from FastAPI

First, our Python server needs to know how to deliver our frontend files (`index.html`, `style.css`, etc.) to the browser.

### Create the Frontend Folder Structure

Inside your `backend` directory, create the folders that will hold your static assets.

- **On macOS/Linux:**
  ```bash
  mkdir -p static/css static/js
  ```
- **On Windows PowerShell:**
  ```powershell
  New-Item -ItemType Directory -Force -Path static\css
  New-Item -ItemType Directory -Force -Path static\js
  ```

The `-p` (or `-Force`) flag creates parent directories if they don't exist, which is a handy shortcut.

### Configure FastAPI to Serve the Files

Now, let's tell FastAPI how to handle requests for these files.

**Update `backend/main.py`:**

```python
# ADD these imports at the top of main.py
from fastapi.staticfiles import StaticFiles
from fastapi.responses import FileResponse
from pathlib import Path # Ensure this is imported

# ... keep existing imports and app = FastAPI(...) line ...

# --- Mount Static Files Directory ---
# This tells FastAPI that any request starting with "/static" is not an API endpoint.
# Instead, it should be treated as a request for a file from the "static" directory.
# This is handled by a highly optimized sub-application.
app.mount("/static", StaticFiles(directory="static"), name="static")


# --- REPLACE your old root ("/") endpoint with this one ---
@app.get("/")
def serve_frontend():
    """
    This endpoint serves the main index.html file for the root URL.
    This is the entry point for our Single-Page Application (SPA).
    """
    return FileResponse("static/index.html")

# ... keep all your other API endpoints (/api/files, etc.) ...
```

---

## 2.2: HTML - The Structure Layer

HTML (HyperText Markup Language) provides the skeleton of your web page. We'll use **semantic HTML tags** (`<header>`, `<main>`, `<section>`) instead of just generic `<div>`s. This is crucial for **accessibility** (screen readers) and **SEO** (search engines).

### Create `index.html`

Create a new file at `backend/static/index.html`.

```html
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html lang="en">
  <head>
    <meta charset="UTF-8" />
    <meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0" />
    <title>PDM - Parts Data Management</title>
    <link rel="stylesheet" href="/static/css/style.css" />
  </head>
  <body>
    <header>
      <h1>PDM System</h1>
      <p>Parts Data Management</p>
    </header>

    <main>
      <section id="file-list-section">
        <h2>Available Files</h2>
        <div id="file-list">
          <p>Loading files...</p>
        </div>
      </section>
    </main>

    <footer>
      <p>&copy; 2025 PDM Tutorial</p>
    </footer>

    <script src="/static/js/app.js" defer></script>
  </body>
</html>
```

---

## 2.3: CSS - The Presentation Layer

CSS (Cascading Style Sheets) adds style to your HTML. We'll start with some professional defaults and styles for our components.

### Create `style.css`

Create a new file at `backend/static/css/style.css`.

```css
/* ============================================ */
/* RESET & GLOBAL STYLES                      */
/* ============================================ */

/* A modern reset: ensures a consistent starting point across all browsers. */

}

body {
  font-family: system-ui, -apple-system, BlinkMacSystemFont, "Segoe UI", sans-serif; /* System font stack for native look and performance. */
  line-height: 1.6;

#file-list {
  display: flex; /* Enables flexbox layout. */
  flex-direction: column; /* Stacks items vertically. */
  gap: 1rem; /* Modern way to add space between flex items. */
}

.file-item {
  padding: 1rem;
  border: 1px solid #e0e0e0;
  border-radius: 4px;
  display: flex;
  justify-content: space-between; /* Pushes children to opposite ends. */
  align-items: center; /* Vertically aligns children. */
  transition: all 0.2s ease-out; /* Smoothly animates changes on hover. */
}

.file-item:hover {
  border-color: #667eea;
  transform: translateX(5px);
  box-shadow: 0 4px 8px rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.05);
}

.file-name {
  font-weight: 600;
}

.file-status {
  padding: 0.25rem 0.75rem;
  border-radius: 9999px; /* A large value to create a "pill" shape. */
  font-size: 0.9rem;
  font-weight: 500;
}

.status-available {
  background-color: #d4edda;
  color: #155724;
}
.status-checked_out {
  background-color: #fff3cd;
  color: #856404;
}
```

Refresh your browser. Your page should now be styled\!

---

## 2.4: JavaScript - The Behavior Layer

JavaScript brings the page to life. It will fetch data from your API and dynamically update the **DOM** (Document Object Model)—the browser's in-memory representation of your HTML.

### Create `app.js`

Create a new file at `backend/static/js/app.js`.

```javascript
// This event listener waits until the browser has fully parsed the HTML
// before running our main code. This is possible because we used the `defer`
// attribute on our <script> tag.
document.addEventListener("DOMContentLoaded", function () {
  console.log("DOM fully loaded and parsed");
  loadFiles(); // Initial call to fetch and display files.
});

/**
 * Fetches the list of files from our backend API.
 */
async function loadFiles() {
  console.log("Loading files from API...");
  const fileListContainer = document.getElementById("file-list");
  fileListContainer.innerHTML = "<p>Loading files...</p>";

  try {
    // `fetch` is the modern browser API for making HTTP requests. It returns a Promise.
    // `await` pauses the function until the Promise resolves (the request completes).
    const response = await fetch("/api/files");

    if (!response.ok) {
      // If the server responded with an error (e.g., 404, 500), throw an error.
      throw new Error(`HTTP error! status: ${response.status}`);
    }

    // `await response.json()` is also async, as it reads and parses the response body.
    const data = await response.json();
    console.log("Received data:", data);

    // Pass the array of files to the function that builds the HTML.
    displayFiles(data.files);
  } catch (error) {
    console.error("Error loading files:", error);
    fileListContainer.innerHTML = `<p style="color: red;">Error: ${error.message}</p>`;
  }
}

/**
 * Renders the list of files into the DOM.
 * @param {Array} files - An array of file objects from the API.
 */
function displayFiles(files) {
  const container = document.getElementById("file-list");
  container.innerHTML = ""; // Clear any previous content (like the loading message).

  if (!files || files.length === 0) {
    container.innerHTML = "<p>No files found.</p>";
    return;
  }

  // Loop through each file object and create an HTML element for it.
  files.forEach((file) => {
    const fileElement = createFileElement(file);
    container.appendChild(fileElement); // Add the newly created element to the page.
  });
}

/**
 * Creates a single DOM element for a file. This is a "factory" function.
 * @param {object} file - The file object with `name` and `status`.
 * @returns {HTMLElement} The created <div> element.
 */
function createFileElement(file) {
  // 1. Create elements in memory. They are not on the page yet.
  const div = document.createElement("div");
  div.className = "file-item"; // Apply our CSS classes.

  const nameSpan = document.createElement("span");
  nameSpan.className = "file-name";
  // CRITICAL: Always use `.textContent` to insert data, not `.innerHTML`.
  // This prevents Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) attacks by automatically
  // treating all input as plain text, not as runnable HTML.
  nameSpan.textContent = file.name;

  const statusSpan = document.createElement("span");
  statusSpan.className = `file-status status-${file.status}`;
  statusSpan.textContent = file.status.replace("_", " ");

  // 2. Assemble the elements into a single parent.
  div.appendChild(nameSpan);
  div.appendChild(statusSpan);

  // 3. Return the fully assembled (but still off-page) element.
  return div;
}
```

### Refresh and Test

Refresh your browser one last time. The "Loading files..." message will briefly appear and then be replaced by the list of files, fetched live from your FastAPI backend\! Use the DevTools **Network** tab to see the `/api/files` request and its JSON response.

---

## Stage 2 Complete - A Full Frontend\!

You have now built a complete frontend that is served by your backend and dynamically displays data from your API.

### What's Next?

In **Stage 3**, we'll make the backend "real." We will stop using hardcoded data and instead read files from the filesystem, implement the core PDM feature of file locking, and learn how to handle the security risks of concurrent operations.

Excellent. Your goal to "graduate from coder to software engineer" is exactly the right mindset. A coder makes things work; a software engineer understands _why_ they work, what the trade-offs are, and how to build systems that are robust, maintainable, and secure.

This stage is perfect for that journey. We'll be digging into the "nuts and bolts" of how a server interacts with the filesystem, handles concurrency, and manages state—all core software engineering topics. I'm happy to go deeper into the `os` library, computer science concepts, and design patterns as we go.

Let's begin the fully expanded and unified **Stage 3**.

---

# Stage 3: App Core Features - Real File Operations & Locking (Expanded & Unified)

## Introduction: The Goal of This Stage

So far, our application has been using hardcoded, "dummy" data. Now, we're going to build its core logic and make it real. We will connect the backend to the filesystem to read actual files, implement a locking mechanism to prevent users from overwriting each other's work (the central feature of a PDM system), and persist this lock information.

This stage is where we solve the primary business problem: ensuring data integrity in a collaborative environment.

---

### **🧠 Foundational Concepts: A Deeper Look**

- **Time Investment:** 5-7 hours. This stage is dense with core CS and engineering concepts.
- **Design Pattern: Repository Pattern**. We'll be creating a set of functions (`load_locks`, `save_locks`) that act as an interface to our data source (the `locks.json` file). This abstracts away the implementation details. If we later decide to switch from a JSON file to a PostgreSQL database (as we will in Stage 11), we only need to change the code inside these repository functions; the rest of our application logic remains untouched. This is a powerful technique for building maintainable software.
- **Software Engineering Principle: Single Responsibility Principle (SRP)**. Each function will do one thing and do it well. `get_files` will only read the file list. `save_locks` will only handle the atomic saving of lock data. This separation of concerns makes our code easier to understand, test, and debug.
- **Computer Science Topic: Inodes**. On Unix-like systems (macOS/Linux), the filesystem doesn't store file metadata (like permissions, size, and timestamps) with the file's content. It stores it in a separate data structure called an **inode**. When we ask for a file's size with `os.stat()`, the system just reads this tiny inode, not the entire file content, which is why it's incredibly fast, even for gigabyte-sized files.

---

## 3.1: The Filesystem and Path Management

Our server application needs to interact with files on the operating system. To do this reliably, we must master path management.

### The `os` vs. `pathlib` Modules

Python provides two primary ways to work with filesystem paths: the older `os.path` module and the modern, object-oriented `pathlib` module. **We will use `pathlib`**, as it is the professional standard for writing clean, safe, and cross-platform path manipulation code.

| Feature                   | `os.path` (Old, Functional)       | `pathlib` (Modern, Object-Oriented) |
| :------------------------ | :-------------------------------- | :---------------------------------- |
| **Joining Paths**         | `os.path.join("dir", "file.txt")` | `Path("dir") / "file.txt"`          |
| **Getting Absolute Path** | `os.path.abspath("file.txt")`     | `Path("file.txt").resolve()`        |
| **Checking Existence**    | `os.path.exists("file.txt")`      | `Path("file.txt").exists()`         |
| **Getting Parent Dir**    | `os.path.dirname(path)`           | `my_path.parent`                    |
| **Reading Text**          | `with open(path) as f: f.read()`  | `my_path.read_text()`               |

### Defining Reliable Paths in `main.py`

The most common source of bugs in server applications is incorrect handling of relative vs. absolute paths. A script's "current working directory" (`os.getcwd()`) can change depending on how it's started. We will **always** construct absolute paths from the location of our `main.py` file.

**Add this code to the top of `backend/main.py`:**

```python
# ADD this to the top of backend/main.py
import os
from pathlib import Path
import json
from datetime import datetime, timezone

# --- Path Definitions ---
# `__file__` is a special Python variable that holds the path to the current script.
# `Path(__file__)` creates a Path object from it.
# `.resolve()` makes the path absolute (e.g., /Users/you/pdm-tutorial/backend/main.py).
# `.parent` gets the directory containing the file.
# This is the most robust way to get your project's root directory.
BASE_DIR = Path(__file__).resolve().parent

# Now, define all other important paths relative to this secure base.
# The '/' operator in pathlib automatically handles Windows `\` vs. macOS/Linux `/`.
REPO_PATH = BASE_DIR / 'repo'
LOCKS_FILE = BASE_DIR / 'locks.json'
```

---

## 3.2: Creating the Repository Structure

Let's create the physical directory on our filesystem where the `.mcam` files will be stored.

### Create the `repo` Directory & Sample Files

In your terminal, from the `backend` directory:

- **On macOS/Linux:**
  ```bash
  mkdir repo
  echo "G0 X0 Y0" > repo/PN1001_OP1.mcam
  echo "G0 X10 Y10" > repo/PN1002_OP1.mcam
  ```
- **On Windows PowerShell:**
  ```powershell
  New-Item -ItemType Directory -Name repo
  "G0 X0 Y0" | Set-Content -Path repo\PN1001_OP1.mcam
  "G0 X10 Y10" | Set-Content -Path repo\PN1002_OP1.mcam
  ```

You now have a `repo` folder inside `backend` containing your sample files.

---

## 3.3: Reading the File List from the Filesystem

Now, we'll replace the hardcoded file list in our `get_files` endpoint with code that actually scans our new `repo` directory.

### Update the `/api/files` Endpoint

Replace the entire `get_files` function in `main.py` with this new, improved version.

```python
# REPLACE your old get_files function with this one

@app.get("/api/files")
def get_files():
    """
    Scans the repository directory and returns a list of all .mcam files found,
    along with their current lock status.
    """
    logger.info(f"Scanning repository at: {REPO_PATH}")

    # --- Defensive Check (Guard Clause) ---
    # A professional application should always validate its environment.
    # If the configured repository directory doesn't exist, it's a critical
    # server error, so we fail fast with a 500 status code.
    if not REPO_PATH.exists() or not REPO_PATH.is_dir():
        logger.error(f"Repository path does not exist or is not a directory: {REPO_PATH}")
        raise HTTPException(status_code=500, detail="Server repository not found.")

    # We'll make this dynamic by reading our locks file in a moment.
    locks = {} # For now, assume no files are locked.

    files = []
    # `os.listdir` is a fast, low-level system call to get all item names in a directory.
    # The operation has O(n) complexity, where n is the number of files.
    for filename in os.listdir(REPO_PATH):
        full_path = REPO_PATH / filename

        # Filter for files only (not subdirectories) and ensure the correct extension.
        if full_path.is_file() and filename.lower().endswith('.mcam'):
            lock_info = locks.get(filename)

            # `full_path.stat().st_size` reads file metadata (the inode) without
            # reading the entire file's content, making it extremely fast.
            files.append({
                "name": filename,
                "status": "checked_out" if lock_info else "available",
                "size_bytes": full_path.stat().st_size,
                "locked_by": lock_info["user"] if lock_info else None
            })

    logger.info(f"Found and returning {len(files)} .mcam files.")
    return {"files": files}
```

Restart your server and visit `http://127.0.0.1:8000`. Your frontend should now display the real files from your `repo/` directory\!

---

## 3.4: Persisting State in a JSON File

To make our lock status real, we need a place to store it. We'll use a `locks.json` file as our simple database.

### Create `locks.json`

Create an empty file named `locks.json` inside your `backend` directory.

```json
{}
```

### The `load_locks` and `save_locks` Repository Functions

These functions will form our "Repository Pattern." They are the only parts of our code that will know _how_ to read and write lock data.

**Add these functions to `main.py`:**

```python
# ADD these helper functions to main.py

def load_locks() -> dict:
    """
    Safely loads the locks.json file.
    This is part of our data access layer (Repository Pattern).
    """
    if not LOCKS_FILE.exists():
        return {}

    try:
        # The 'with' statement implements the Context Manager protocol.
        # It guarantees that f.close() is called, even if errors occur.
        # It's equivalent to a try...finally block.
        with open(LOCKS_FILE, 'r') as f:
            return json.load(f) # .load() reads from a file-like object.
    except (json.JSONDecodeError, IOError) as e:
        logger.error(f"Error reading or parsing locks.json: {e}")
        return {} # On error, return an empty state to prevent the app from crashing.

def save_locks(locks: dict):
    """
    Safely saves the locks dictionary to locks.json.
    """
    try:
        with open(LOCKS_FILE, 'w') as f:
            # .dump() writes to a file-like object.
            # indent=4 makes the JSON file human-readable for debugging.
            json.dump(locks, f, indent=4)
    except IOError as e:
        logger.error(f"Error writing to locks.json: {e}")
        # If we can't save state, it's a critical server failure.
        raise HTTPException(status_code=500, detail="Failed to save application state.")
```

Now, **update the `get_files` function** one last time to use `load_locks()`:

```python
# In the get_files function, change `locks = {}` to:
locks = load_locks()
```

---

## 3.5: Implementing Checkout & Checkin Logic

Now we can implement the core logic of our PDM system.

### The Checkout Endpoint

Replace your old `/api/checkout` endpoint in `main.py` with this complete version.

```python
# REPLACE your old /api/checkout endpoint with this one

@app.post("/api/files/checkout")
def checkout_file(request: FileCheckoutRequest, current_user: User = Depends(get_current_user)):
    logger.info(f"Checkout request: {request.user} -> {request.filename}")

    # --- Validation ---
    file_path = REPO_PATH / request.filename
    if not file_path.exists():
        raise HTTPException(status_code=404, detail="File to check out not found.")

    locks = load_locks()

    if request.filename in locks:
        existing_lock = locks[request.filename]
        logger.warning(f"Checkout failed: {request.filename} is already locked by {existing_lock['user']}")
        # HTTP 409 Conflict is the semantically correct status code for a state conflict.
        raise HTTPException(
            status_code=409,
            detail=f"File is already checked out by {existing_lock['user']}."
        )

    # --- State Mutation ---
    locks[request.filename] = {
        "user": current_user.username,
        "timestamp": datetime.now(timezone.utc).isoformat(),
        "message": request.message
    }
    save_locks(locks)

    logger.info(f"File '{request.filename}' checked out successfully by '{current_user.username}'")
    return {"success": True, "message": "File checked out successfully"}
```

### The Checkin Endpoint

Add this new endpoint to `main.py`.

```python
# ADD this new endpoint and its Pydantic model to main.py
class FileCheckinRequest(BaseModel):
    filename: str

@app.post("/api/files/checkin")
def checkin_file(request: FileCheckinRequest, current_user: User = Depends(get_current_user)):
    logger.info(f"Checkin request from '{current_user.username}' for '{request.filename}'")

    locks = load_locks()

    if request.filename not in locks:
        raise HTTPException(status_code=400, detail="File is not currently checked out.")

    # Authorization Check: Is the person checking in the owner of the lock?
    # (Admins will be able to override this in Stage 6)
    if locks[request.filename]['user'] != current_user.username:
        lock_owner = locks[request.filename]['user']
        logger.warning(f"AuthZ failed: User '{current_user.username}' tried to check in a file locked by '{lock_owner}'.")
        raise HTTPException(status_code=403, detail=f"You do not own the lock on this file. It is locked by '{lock_owner}'.")

    # --- State Mutation ---
    del locks[request.filename]
    save_locks(locks)

    logger.info(f"File '{request.filename}' checked in successfully by '{current_user.username}'")
    return {"success": True, "message": "File checked in successfully"}
```

---

## 3.6: Race Conditions - A Critical CS Topic

Our application has a hidden, critical flaw: a **race condition**. This occurs when the outcome of a sequence of operations depends on the unpredictable timing of concurrent events.

**The Scenario (TOCTOU: Time-of-Check to Time-of-Use):**

1.  **Request A (Alice):** Runs `load_locks()`. Sees the file is available.
2.  **OS Task Switch:** The OS pauses A's request and switches to B.
3.  **Request B (Bob):** Runs `load_locks()`. It also sees the file is available, because A hasn't saved yet.
4.  **OS Task Switch:** Back to A.
5.  **Request A:** Adds its lock and runs `save_locks()`. The file is now locked by Alice.
6.  **OS Task Switch:** Back to B.
7.  **Request B:** Adds its lock and runs `save_locks()`. **It overwrites Alice's lock.**

**Result:** Both users think they have the file. The last one to write wins. Data corruption is inevitable.

#### 🏋️ Practice Exercise: Race Condition Simulator

This script uses Python's `threading` module to reliably reproduce the race condition. Create `backend/race_condition_simulator.py`.

```python
# backend/race_condition_simulator.py
import threading
import time

locks = {} # Our shared, unprotected resource

def unsafe_checkout(filename, user):
    print(f"[{user}] Checking if '{filename}' is available...")
    # Time-of-Check
    if filename not in locks:
        # A tiny delay is all it takes for another thread to sneak in!
        time.sleep(0.001)
        # Time-of-Use
        print(f"[{user}] Lock is available! Acquiring...")
        locks[filename] = user
    else:
        print(f"[{user}] Could not acquire lock, already held by {locks[filename]}")

# Create two threads trying to do the same thing at the same time
thread1 = threading.Thread(target=unsafe_checkout, args=("PN1001.mcam", "Alice"))
thread2 = threading.Thread(target=unsafe_checkout, args=("PN1001.mcam", "Bob"))

thread1.start()
thread2.start()

thread1.join()
thread2.join()

print(f"\nFinal lock state: {locks}")
# Expected: Only one user should have the lock.
# Actual: The last user to write wins, but both think they succeeded!
```

Run `python race_condition_simulator.py`. You'll see both Alice and Bob believe they acquired the lock.

### The Solution: Atomic Operations with OS-Level File Locks

We need to make the entire **read -\> modify -\> write** sequence **atomic** (indivisible). We do this by asking the operating system to place a lock on `locks.json` itself.

This requires different system calls on Windows (`msvcrt`) vs. macOS/Linux (`fcntl`). We can create a cross-platform context manager to handle this.

**Add this class to `main.py`:**

```python
# ADD this cross-platform locking class to main.py
if os.name == 'nt':
    import msvcrt
else:
    import fcntl

class LockedFile:
    """A cross-platform context manager for file locking."""
    # ... (code from the previous response for this class) ...
```

**Now, update `load_locks` and `save_locks` to use it:**

```python
# REPLACE your load_locks and save_locks functions

def load_locks() -> dict:
    if not LOCKS_FILE.exists():
        return {}
    try:
        with LockedFile(LOCKS_FILE, 'r') as f: # Now uses the lock
            return json.load(f)
    except Exception as e:
        logger.error(f"Error reading locked file: {e}")
        return {}

def save_locks(locks: dict):
    try:
        with LockedFile(LOCKS_FILE, 'w') as f: # Now uses the lock
            json.dump(locks, f, indent=4)
    except Exception as e:
        logger.error(f"Error writing locked file: {e}")
        raise HTTPException(status_code=500, detail="Failed to save application state.")
```

Now the race condition is impossible. The OS guarantees atomicity.

## 3.7: Final Frontend Updates

Finally, update `app.js` to call our new endpoints.

```javascript
// REPLACE the old handleCheckout and handleCheckin functions in app.js

async function handleCheckout(filename) {
  const user = prompt("Enter your name:");
  if (!user) return;
  const message = prompt("Reason for checkout:");
  if (!message) return;

  try {
    const response = await fetch("/api/files/checkout", {
      method: "POST",
      headers: { "Content-Type": "application/json" },
      body: JSON.stringify({ filename, user, message }),
    });
    const data = await response.json();
    if (!response.ok) throw new Error(data.detail);

    alert("File checked out successfully!");
    loadFiles(); // Refresh the list to show new status
  } catch (error) {
    alert(`Error: ${error.message}`);
  }
}

async function handleCheckin(filename) {
  const user = prompt("Enter your name to confirm check-in:");
  if (!user) return;

  try {
    const response = await fetch("/api/files/checkin", {
      method: "POST",
      headers: { "Content-Type": "application/json" },
      body: JSON.stringify({ filename, user }),
    });
    const data = await response.json();
    if (!response.ok) throw new Error(data.detail);

    alert("File checked in successfully!");
    loadFiles();
  } catch (error) {
    alert(`Error: ${error.message}`);
  }
}
```

## Stage 3 Complete - A Real Application\!

You've built the core logic of your PDM system, complete with real filesystem interaction and robust protection against concurrency bugs.

### Final Code Snapshot

Your `main.py` is now significantly more complex, containing path definitions, multiple endpoints, Pydantic models, and helper functions for locking and data access. Your `app.js` now has handlers that make `POST` requests to your backend.

### What's Next?

The application is functional, but the UI is still clunky. In **Stage 4**, we'll focus entirely on the frontend experience, replacing the jarring `prompt()` dialogs with smooth, custom modal forms and adding powerful client-side search and sorting.

Yes, this is the **perfect** time to do a deep dive into REST.

You've made a great observation. Now that you've built a functional API with several endpoints, methods (`GET`, `POST`), and status codes (`200`, `404`, `409`), the abstract principles of REST will make much more sense. They will provide the "why" behind the code you've already written and give you a professional framework for designing all future APIs.

Let's create "Stage 3A" as a dedicated conceptual playground. This will keep the learning separate from our main application code, just as you suggested.

---

# Stage 3A: A Deep Dive into RESTful API Design

## Introduction: The "Grammar" of the Web

If HTTP is the language of the web, **REST** is its grammar. It’s not a strict protocol or standard, but an **architectural style**—a set of guiding principles for designing networked applications. When an API follows these principles, we call it **RESTful**.

The goal of REST is to create APIs that are predictable, scalable, and durable. By following these conventions, any developer who understands REST can quickly understand how to use your API without needing to read pages of documentation.

---

### **🧠 Foundational Concepts: The Six Constraints of REST**

REST was defined by Roy Fielding in his 2000 doctoral dissertation. He outlined six guiding constraints.

1.  **Client-Server Architecture**: The client (frontend) and server (backend) are separated. This is the foundation of our entire PDM application.
2.  **Statelessness**: Every request from a client to the server must contain all the information needed to understand and complete the request. The server does not store any client "session" state between requests. This is why we will send a JWT with every request in Stage 5. Statelessness makes an API highly scalable.
3.  **Cacheability**: Responses must be able to be labeled as cacheable or not. This allows clients or intermediary proxies to reuse old responses, dramatically improving performance.
4.  **Layered System**: A client cannot ordinarily tell whether it is connected directly to the end server, or to an intermediary along the way (like a load balancer or a proxy). This allows for scalable and modular architectures. Our Nginx setup in Stage 11 will be a perfect example of this.
5.  **Code on Demand (Optional)**: Servers can temporarily extend or customize the functionality of a client by transferring logic it can execute (e.g., JavaScript). Our entire frontend is an example of this.
6.  **Uniform Interface**: This is the most important constraint and the heart of REST. It has four sub-constraints:
    - **a. Identification of Resources (Nouns, not Verbs)**: Resources are identified by URIs (e.g., `/files`, `/users/123`). The URL should represent a _thing_ (a noun), not an _action_ (a verb).
      - ✅ **Good (RESTful):** `GET /api/files/PN1001`
      - ❌ **Bad (Not RESTful):** `GET /api/getFileByName?name=PN1001`
    - **b. Manipulation Through Representations**: Clients use standard HTTP methods (`GET`, `POST`, `PUT`, `PATCH`, `DELETE`) to manipulate these resources. The verb is in the HTTP method, not the URL.
    - **c. Self-Descriptive Messages**: Each response should contain enough information for the client to process it, primarily by using standard **Media Types** (like `Content-Type: application/json`).
    - **d. Hypermedia as the Engine of Application State (HATEOAS)**: This is the most advanced principle. It means that a response should include links that tell the client what actions they can perform next. For example, a response for a file might include a link to check it out.

## The REST Playground

Let's make these concepts concrete. Create a new file, `backend/rest_playground.py`. This will be a temporary, separate FastAPI application where we can experiment.

### The Playground Code

```python
# backend/rest_playground.py

from fastapi import FastAPI, HTTPException, status, Response
from pydantic import BaseModel, Field
from typing import List, Optional

# --- Application Setup ---
app = FastAPI(
    title="REST Playground",
    description="A simple API to demonstrate REST principles."
)

# --- In-Memory "Database" ---
# A simple dictionary to act as our data store.
# The key is the item_id.
db = {
    1: {"name": "Wrench", "size": 10},
    2: {"name": "Screwdriver", "size": 8},
    3: {"name": "Hammer", "size": 12},
}

# --- Pydantic Models (Schemas) ---
class Item(BaseModel):
    name: str = Field(..., min_length=3)
    size: int = Field(..., gt=0) # Must be greater than 0

class ItemUpdate(BaseModel):
    # For PATCH, all fields are optional.
    name: Optional[str] = Field(None, min_length=3)
    size: Optional[int] = Field(None, gt=0)

# --- Endpoints ---

# 1. GET a collection of resources
@app.get("/items", response_model=List[Item])
def get_all_items():
    """Returns a list of all items in the database."""
    return list(db.values())

# 2. POST to create a new resource
@app.post("/items", response_model=Item, status_code=status.HTTP_201_CREATED)
def create_item(item: Item):
    """Creates a new item and adds it to the database."""
    new_id = max(db.keys() or [0]) + 1
    db[new_id] = item.dict()
    return db[new_id]

# 3. GET a specific resource
@app.get("/items/{item_id}", response_model=Item)
def get_item(item_id: int):
    """Returns a single item by its ID."""
    if item_id not in db:
        raise HTTPException(status_code=404, detail="Item not found")

    # HATEOAS Example: The response includes links to possible next actions.
    response_data = db[item_id]
    response_data["_links"] = {
        "self": {"href": f"/items/{item_id}"},
        "collection": {"href": "/items"}
    }
    return response_data

# 4. PUT to replace a resource (Idempotent)
@app.put("/items/{item_id}", response_model=Item)
def replace_item(item_id: int, item: Item):
    """Replaces an existing item entirely."""
    if item_id not in db:
        raise HTTPException(status_code=404, detail="Item not found")
    db[item_id] = item.dict()
    return db[item_id]

# 5. PATCH to partially update a resource
@app.patch("/items/{item_id}", response_model=Item)
def update_item(item_id: int, item_update: ItemUpdate):
    """Partially updates an existing item."""
    if item_id not in db:
        raise HTTPException(status_code=404, detail="Item not found")

    stored_item = db[item_id]
    update_data = item_update.dict(exclude_unset=True) # Gets only the fields that were provided

    updated_item = stored_item.copy()
    updated_item.update(update_data)

    db[item_id] = updated_item
    return updated_item

# 6. DELETE a resource (Idempotent)
@app.delete("/items/{item_id}", status_code=status.HTTP_204_NO_CONTENT)
def delete_item(item_id: int):
    """Deletes an item from the database."""
    if item_id not in db:
        raise HTTPException(status_code=404, detail="Item not found")
    del db[item_id]
    # A 204 response must not have a body.
    return Response(status_code=status.HTTP_204_NO_CONTENT)
```

### Running and Interacting with the Playground

Run this separate app from your terminal:

```bash
uvicorn backend.rest_playground:app --reload
```

Now, open a **new terminal** and use `curl` to interact with your RESTful API.

**1. GET all items:**

```bash
curl http://localhost:8000/items
```

> **Response:** A JSON array of all items.

**2. POST a new item:**

```bash
curl -X POST http://localhost:8000/items \
-H "Content-Type: application/json" \
-d '{"name": "Pliers", "size": 6}'
```

> **Response:** The newly created item with a `201 Created` status.

**3. GET a single item (with HATEOAS links):**

```bash
curl http://localhost:8000/items/1
```

> **Response:** The "Wrench" item, now with a `_links` object showing you how to get back to this resource or the full collection.

**4. PUT to replace an item:** (Note: we must provide all fields)

```bash
curl -X PUT http://localhost:8000/items/1 \
-H "Content-Type: application/json" \
-d '{"name": "Large Wrench", "size": 14}'
```

> **Response:** The updated "Large Wrench" item.

**5. PATCH to partially update an item:** (Note: we only provide the `size`)

```bash
curl -X PATCH http://localhost:8000/items/2 \
-H "Content-Type: application/json" \
-d '{"size": 9}'
```

> **Response:** The "Screwdriver" item, with its name unchanged but its size updated to 9.

**6. DELETE an item:**

```bash
curl -v -X DELETE http://localhost:8000/items/3
```

> **Response:** You will get a `204 No Content` status and no response body. If you now `GET /items`, the "Hammer" will be gone.

## Conclusion: Tying it Back to the PDM App

This playground demonstrates the "grammar" of a well-designed API. Our PDM app already follows many of these principles:

- **Resources:** We have `/api/files` and `/api/files/{filename}`.
- **Verbs:** We use `GET` to read and `POST` to create a new state (a checkout).
- **Self-Descriptive:** We use `application/json`.

As we continue, we will keep these principles in mind. The `delete_file` endpoint in Stage 6 will use `DELETE`, and if we add a feature to update a file's metadata, we would use `PATCH`.

This conceptual foundation is a major step in your journey from coder to software engineer. You now have a mental model for designing clean, predictable, and scalable APIs.

With this solid understanding of REST, we are now perfectly prepared to move on to **Stage 4** and build a polished frontend to consume our API.

That's an excellent approach to learning, and honestly, it's the best way to build a deep, intuitive understanding of development. Embracing debugging is what separates a novice from an experienced engineer. I'm happy to guide you through this stage step-by-step, building the UI piece by piece so you can see the immediate impact of your code.

We'll build the final, polished UI from the "Stage 4B" concept, but we'll do it incrementally. For each step, I'll provide the code snippet, explain the "why" behind it, and tell you what change to look for. I'll also point out common errors and how to debug them.

Let's begin **Stage 4**.

---

# Stage 4: Building a Professional Frontend (Expanded & Incremental)

## Introduction: The Goal of This Stage

In the previous stages, we built a powerful backend but used temporary `prompt()` dialogs for the frontend. Now, we'll build the real User Interface (UI). We will not just make it functional; we'll build it using professional techniques that make it scalable, maintainable, and beautiful.

We'll break this down into small, manageable components, so you can type the code and see your progress frequently.

---

## 4.1: Laying the Foundation - The Design Token System

Before we write a single line of component CSS, we must define our **design system**. This is our single source of truth for all colors, spacing, fonts, and shadows. By centralizing these decisions in a `tokens.css` file, we make our entire application themeable and consistent.

### **Step 1: Create the CSS File Structure**

First, let's create the organized file structure we'll be using. In your `backend/static/css/` directory, create the following files:

- `tokens.css`: For our design system variables.
- `base.css`: For default styles on raw HTML elements (`body`, `h1`, `p`, etc.).
- `components.css`: For styling our custom components like buttons, cards, and modals.
- `main.css`: This file will do nothing but import the others in the correct order.

### **Step 2: Create Your Design Tokens**

Copy the complete `tokens.css` content from the "Stage 4B" artifact into your new `backend/static/css/tokens.css` file. This file contains our entire color palette, spacing scale, and semantic variables for both light and dark themes. It's the foundation for everything that follows.

- **Further Reading**:
  - CSS Custom Properties (MDN): [https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/Using_CSS_custom_properties](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/Using_CSS_custom_properties)

### **Step 3: Create the Base Styles**

Now, create `backend/static/css/base.css`. This file resets browser defaults and applies your tokens to basic HTML tags.

```css
/* backend/static/css/base.css */
*,
*::before,
*::after {
  box-sizing: border-box;
  margin: 0;
  padding: 0;
}

body {
  background-color: var(--bg-primary);
  color: var(--text-primary);
  font-family: system-ui, -apple-system, sans-serif;
  line-height: var(--line-height-base);
  /* This transition will make our dark mode switch feel smooth */
  transition: background-color var(--transition-base), color var(--transition-base);
}

h1,
h2,
h3 {
  font-weight: var(--font-weight-bold);
  line-height: var(--line-height-tight);
}

h1 {
  font-size: var(--font-size-4xl);
}
h2 {
  font-size: var(--font-size-3xl);
  margin-bottom: var(--spacing-6);
  color: var(--color-primary-500);
}
h3 {
  font-size: var(--font-size-2xl);
}

a {
  color: var(--text-link);
  text-decoration: none;
}
a:hover {
  text-decoration: underline;
  color: var(--text-link-hover);
}
```

### **Step 4: Create the CSS Entry Point**

Your `main.css` file will use `@import` to load the other files in the correct order. This is critical for the CSS cascade to work properly.

```css
/* backend/static/css/main.css */

/* Import in ITCSS order (Inverted Triangle CSS) */
/* 1. Settings (Tokens) */
@import "tokens.css";

/* 2. Elements (Base) */
@import "base.css";

/* 3. Components (we will add this next) */
@import "components.css";
```

Create an empty `components.css` file for now so the import doesn't fail.

### **Step 5: Update `index.html`**

Finally, update `backend/static/index.html` to load our new CSS and prepare for the theme switcher.

**Update your entire `<head>` section in `index.html` to this:**

```html
<head>
  <meta charset="UTF-8" />
  <meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0" />
  <title>PDM - Parts Data Management</title>

  <link rel="stylesheet" href="/static/css/main.css" />

  <script src="/static/js/theme.js"></script>
</head>
```

And add the `defer` attribute to your `app.js` script tag at the bottom of the `<body>`:

```html
<script src="/static/js/app.js" defer></script>
```

**Checkpoint:** At this point, if you refresh your browser, the page should have a clean, basic style with your chosen font and colors applied to the existing text. The "feel" of the page should already be much more professional.

---

## 4.2: Building the First Components: Header & Theme Toggle

Let's build our first visible components using the design tokens.

### **Step 1: The Theme Manager (`theme.js`)**

This script handles detecting the user's system preference (light/dark), saving their choice, and applying the theme.

**Create `backend/static/js/theme.js`:**

```javascript
// backend/static/js/theme.js
class ThemeManager {
  constructor() {
    this.STORAGE_KEY = "pdm-theme";
    this.init();
  }

  init() {
    const storedTheme = localStorage.getItem(this.STORAGE_KEY);
    const systemPrefersDark = window.matchMedia(
      "(prefers-color-scheme: dark)"
    ).matches;
    const theme = storedTheme || (systemPrefersDark ? "dark" : "light");
    this.applyTheme(theme);
    this.listenForSystemChanges();
  }

  applyTheme(theme) {
    document.documentElement.setAttribute("data-theme", theme);
  }

  toggleTheme() {
    const currentTheme = document.documentElement.getAttribute("data-theme");
    const newTheme = currentTheme === "dark" ? "light" : "dark";
    this.applyTheme(newTheme);
    localStorage.setItem(this.STORAGE_KEY, newTheme);
  }

  listenForSystemChanges() {
    window
      .matchMedia("(prefers-color-scheme: dark)")
      .addEventListener("change", (e) => {
        // Only apply system change if user has not made an explicit choice
        if (!localStorage.getItem(this.STORAGE_KEY)) {
          this.applyTheme(e.matches ? "dark" : "light");
        }
      });
  }
}
const themeManager = new ThemeManager();
```

### **Step 2: Add the Header HTML and Theme Button**

Replace the existing `<header>` in your `index.html` with this new structure.

```html
<header>
  <div class="header-content">
    <div>
      <h1>PDM System</h1>
      <p>Parts Data Management</p>
    </div>
    <div class="header-actions">
      <button id="theme-toggle" class="btn btn-secondary" title="Toggle Theme">
        🌙
      </button>
    </div>
  </div>
</header>
```

### **Step 3: Style the Header and Buttons in CSS**

Now, let's add our first component styles to `components.css`.

**Add to `backend/static/css/components.css`:**

```css
/* backend/static/css/components.css */

/* --- Layout Components --- */
header {
  background: linear-gradient(
    135deg,
    var(--color-primary-500),
    var(--color-primary-700)
  );
  color: var(--text-inverse);
  padding: var(--spacing-6);
  box-shadow: var(--shadow-md);
}
.header-content {
  display: flex;
  justify-content: space-between;
  align-items: center;
  max-width: 1200px;
  margin: 0 auto;
}
.header-actions {
  display: flex;
  align-items: center;
  gap: var(--spacing-4);
}
main {
  max-width: 1200px;
  margin: var(--spacing-8) auto;
  padding: 0 var(--spacing-4);
}

/* --- Button Component --- */
.btn {
  padding: var(--button-padding-y) var(--button-padding-x);
  border-radius: var(--button-border-radius);
  font-weight: var(--font-weight-medium);
  cursor: pointer;
  border: none;
  transition: var(--button-transition);
  display: inline-flex;
  align-items: center;
  justify-content: center;
}
.btn:hover {
  transform: translateY(-2px);
  box-shadow: var(--shadow-sm);
}

.btn-secondary {
  background: var(--button-secondary-bg);
  color: var(--button-secondary-text);
}
.btn-secondary:hover {
  background: var(--button-secondary-bg-hover);
}
```

### **Step 4: Wire up the Theme Toggle in `app.js`**

Finally, add the event listener for our new button.

**Add inside the `DOMContentLoaded` listener in `app.js`:**

```javascript
// In app.js
document.addEventListener("DOMContentLoaded", () => {
  // ... existing code ...

  document.getElementById("theme-toggle").addEventListener("click", () => {
    themeManager.toggleTheme();
  });
});
```

**Checkpoint:** Refresh your browser. You should now see the fully styled header. Click the moon icon. The page should instantly switch to dark mode with a smooth transition\! Open your browser's developer tools, go to the "Application" tab, then "Local Storage" to see how the `pdm-theme` key is being saved.

**Common Pitfalls & Debugging:**

- **"Theme flashes on page load."** This is a classic "Flash of Unstyled Content" (FOUC). It happens if your `theme.js` script is loaded with `defer`. Make sure it's loaded in the `<head>` _without_ `defer` so it can apply the theme before the page is painted.
- **"CSS variables aren't working."** Check the browser inspector. If an element's style shows `color: var(--text-primary)` but is black (the default), it means the variable isn't defined or `tokens.css` isn't loaded correctly. Make sure your `@import` order in `main.css` is correct.

---

## 4.3: Building the Interactive File List

Now we'll refactor the file list to use our new components and prepare it for interactivity.

### **Step 1: Add HTML Structure and CSS**

We'll add a `section` to act as a "card" and create more specific styles for our file list items.

**Replace the `<main>` section in `index.html`:**

```html
<main class="container">
  <section>
    <h2>File Dashboard</h2>
    <div id="loading-indicator" class="hidden"><p>Loading...</p></div>
    <div id="file-list"></div>
  </section>
</main>
```

_Note the `container` class on `<main>` for consistent centering and padding._

**Add to `components.css`:**

```css
/* backend/static/css/components.css */

/* --- Card Component (used by <section>) --- */
section {
  background: var(--card-bg);
  padding: var(--card-padding);
  border-radius: var(--card-border-radius);
  box-shadow: var(--card-shadow);
  border: 1px solid var(--border-default);
  transition: background-color var(--transition-base), border-color var(--transition-base);
}

/* --- File List Component --- */
#file-list {
  display: flex;
  flex-direction: column;
  gap: var(--spacing-4);
}
.file-item {
  padding: var(--spacing-4);
  border: 1px solid var(--border-default);
  border-radius: var(--radius-md);
  display: flex;
  justify-content: space-between;
  align-items: center;
  transition: all var(--transition-base);
  background: var(
    --bg-secondary
  ); /* A slightly different background for list items */
}
.file-item:hover {
  transform: translateX(5px);
  border-color: var(--interactive-primary);
}
.file-name {
  font-weight: var(--font-weight-semibold);
}
.file-status {
  padding: var(--spacing-1) var(--spacing-3);
  border-radius: var(--radius-full);
  font-size: var(--font-size-sm);
  font-weight: var(--font-weight-medium);
}
.status-available {
  background: var(--status-success-bg);
  color: var(--status-success-text);
}
.status-checked_out {
  background: var(--status-warning-bg);
  color: var(--status-warning-text);
}
.file-actions {
  display: flex;
  align-items: center;
  gap: var(--spacing-3);
}

/* Button variants for actions */
.btn-checkout {
  background: var(--status-success);
  color: var(--text-inverse);
}
.btn-checkout:hover {
  background: var(--color-success-600);
}
.btn-checkin {
  background: var(--status-warning);
  color: var(--color-gray-900);
}
.btn-checkin:hover {
  background: var(--color-warning-600);
}
```

### **Step 2: Update `createFileElement` in `app.js`**

Now, refactor the JavaScript factory function to create the buttons that will open our modals.

**Replace the `createFileElement` function in `app.js`:**

```javascript
function createFileElement(file) {
  const div = document.createElement("div");
  div.className = "file-item";

  const infoDiv = document.createElement("div");
  infoDiv.className = "flex items-center gap-4"; // Using layout utilities

  const nameSpan = document.createElement("span");
  nameSpan.className = "file-name";
  nameSpan.textContent = file.name;

  const statusSpan = document.createElement("span");
  statusSpan.className = `file-status status-${file.status}`;
  statusSpan.textContent = file.status.replace("_", " ");

  infoDiv.appendChild(nameSpan);
  infoDiv.appendChild(statusSpan);

  const actionsDiv = document.createElement("div");
  actionsDiv.className = "file-actions";

  if (file.status === "available") {
    const checkoutBtn = document.createElement("button");
    checkoutBtn.className = "btn btn-checkout";
    checkoutBtn.textContent = "Checkout";
    // This will call our handler to open the modal
    checkoutBtn.onclick = () => handleCheckout(file.name);
    actionsDiv.appendChild(checkoutBtn);
  } else {
    const checkinBtn = document.createElement("button");
    checkinBtn.className = "btn btn-checkin";
    checkinBtn.textContent = "Checkin";
    checkinBtn.onclick = () => handleCheckin(file.name);
    actionsDiv.appendChild(checkinBtn);
  }

  div.appendChild(infoDiv);
  div.appendChild(actionsDiv);
  return div;
}
```

**Checkpoint:** Refresh the page. The file list should now appear inside a styled "card," and each item should have a "Checkout" or "Checkin" button. Clicking them won't do anything yet, but we're about to fix that.

---

## 4.4: Building and Integrating the Modal Forms

This is the final big step: replacing `prompt()` with our modal components.

### **Step 1: Add Modal HTML**

Go to your `index.html` file and add the full HTML for the two modals (from the previous response) right before the closing `</body>` tag. This includes the `<form>` elements we need.

### **Step 2: Add Modal CSS**

Add the modal-specific CSS to `components.css`.

**Add to `components.css`:**

```css
/* --- Modal Components --- */
.modal-overlay {
  position: fixed;
  top: 0;
  left: 0;
  right: 0;
  bottom: 0;
  background: var(--modal-backdrop);
  display: flex;
  justify-content: center;
  align-items: center;
  z-index: var(--z-modal);
}
.modal-content {
  background: var(--modal-bg);
  border-radius: var(--modal-border-radius);
  max-width: 500px;
  width: 90%;
  box-shadow: var(--modal-shadow);
  border: 1px solid var(--border-default);
}
.modal-header {
  padding: var(--spacing-6);
  border-bottom: 1px solid var(--border-default);
  display: flex;
  justify-content: space-between;
  align-items: center;
}
.modal-body {
  padding: var(--spacing-6);
}
.modal-actions {
  display: flex;
  gap: var(--spacing-4);
  justify-content: flex-end;
  margin-top: var(--spacing-4);
}
.modal-close {
  background: none;
  border: none;
  font-size: 1.5rem;
  color: var(--text-secondary);
  cursor: pointer;
}
.modal-close:hover {
  color: var(--text-primary);
}
```

### **Step 3: Add the `ModalManager` Class and Form Logic to `app.js`**

This is the final piece of the puzzle. We need to add the `ModalManager` class and the logic to handle form submissions.

**Add to `app.js`:**

```javascript
// Add this class definition to app.js
class ModalManager {
  /* ... full class from previous response ... */
}

// Instantiate the modals
const checkoutModal = new ModalManager("checkout-modal");
const checkinModal = new ModalManager("checkin-modal");

// This is a global variable to track which file the modal is for.
let currentFilename = null;

// Replace your old placeholder handleCheckout/handleCheckin functions
function handleCheckout(filename) {
  currentFilename = filename;
  document.getElementById("checkout-filename").textContent = filename;
  document.getElementById("checkout-form").reset(); // Clear old input
  checkoutModal.open();
}
function handleCheckin(filename) {
  currentFilename = filename;
  document.getElementById("checkin-filename").textContent = filename;
  document.getElementById("checkin-form").reset();
  checkinModal.open();
}

// Add the form submission logic inside the DOMContentLoaded listener
document.addEventListener("DOMContentLoaded", () => {
  // ... other listeners ...

  document
    .getElementById("checkout-form")
    .addEventListener("submit", async (e) => {
      e.preventDefault();
      const user = document.getElementById("checkout-user").value;
      const message = document.getElementById("checkout-message").value;

      try {
        const response = await fetch("/api/files/checkout", {
          method: "POST",
          headers: { "Content-Type": "application/json" },
          body: JSON.stringify({ filename: currentFilename, user, message }),
        });
        const data = await response.json();
        if (!response.ok) throw new Error(data.detail);

        // On success, show a notification, close the modal, and refresh the data
        showNotification("File checked out!", "success");
        checkoutModal.close();
        loadFiles();
      } catch (error) {
        showNotification(`Error: ${error.message}`, "error");
      }
    });

  // Add similar logic for the checkin-form submit event
});
```

**Checkpoint:** You've done it\! Refresh the page. Click a "Checkout" button. A beautiful, non-blocking modal with a form appears. Fill it out and submit. A toast notification appears, the modal closes, and the file list updates to show the new "checked_out" status.

**Common Pitfalls & Debugging:**

- **"Form submission reloads the page."** You forgot `event.preventDefault()` at the start of your submit handler. This is the most common form-handling bug in SPAs.
- **"Submitting the form does nothing."** Check the DevTools Console for errors. You might have a typo in an element ID (`getElementById`) or your event listener might not be wired up correctly.
- **"Server returns 422 Unprocessable Entity."** Open the Network tab, find the failing request, and look at the "Response" tab. FastAPI and Pydantic give you a detailed JSON error telling you exactly which field was missing or invalid in the data you sent.

## Stage 4 Complete - A Polished and Professional UI\!

You have successfully refactored your entire frontend to use a professional architecture. You have a consistent design system, reusable components, and a polished, interactive user experience.

### What's Next?

With a professional and robust frontend in place, we are now ready to secure the application. In **Stage 5**, we will implement a full authentication system, requiring users to log in with a username and password and introducing roles to control permissions.

Of course. Here is the complete, expanded Stage 5 tutorial again, without the image tags.

---

# Stage 5: Authentication & Authorization - A Deep Dive into Web Security (Expanded & Unified)

## Introduction: The Goal of This Stage

Our application is functional but insecure. This stage is dedicated to building a robust security layer. We will not only implement authentication (AuthN) and authorization (AuthZ) but also explore the fundamental cryptographic principles that make them secure.

By the end of this stage, you will:

- Implement secure password hashing and understand why algorithms like `bcrypt` are chosen over `SHA-256`.
- Understand **PKI (Public Key Infrastructure)**, digital signatures, and certificates.
- Create, sign, and validate **JSON Web Tokens (JWTs)** for stateless authentication.
- Build a complete login/logout system and protect API endpoints.
- Connect these practices to the **OWASP Top 10** vulnerabilities and their mitigations.

---

## 5.1: Authentication (AuthN) vs. Authorization (AuthZ)

As we've discussed, these are two distinct security concepts:

1.  **Authentication**: Verifying identity. **"Who are you?"**
2.  **Authorization**: Verifying permissions. **"What are you allowed to do?"**

You must always authenticate _before_ you can authorize.

---

## 5.2: Password Security - Hashing Algorithms Deep Dive

The cardinal rule of security is to **never store plain-text passwords**. We use a one-way cryptographic **hash function**.

### What Makes a Good Hash Function?

A cryptographic hash function has three key properties:

1.  **Deterministic**: The same input always produces the same output.
2.  **One-Way (Pre-image Resistance)**: It is computationally infeasible to reverse the function (i.e., to find the input from the output).
3.  **Collision Resistance**: It is computationally infeasible to find two different inputs that produce the same output.

### Why MD5 and SHA Are Wrong for Passwords

You'll often hear about hashes like MD5, SHA-1, and SHA-256. These are excellent for verifying file integrity but are **terrible for hashing passwords**. Why? **They are too fast.**

Modern GPUs can calculate billions of SHA-256 hashes per second. An attacker who steals your user database can use "rainbow tables" (pre-computed hash lists) or brute-force attacks to crack common passwords in minutes or hours.

### The Right Way: Slow, Key-Stretching Algorithms

For passwords, we need algorithms that are **deliberately slow**. These are called key-stretching or password-based key derivation functions.

| Algorithm   | Type                 | Key Feature                                                          | Status                                                        |
| :---------- | :------------------- | :------------------------------------------------------------------- | :------------------------------------------------------------ |
| **MD5/SHA** | General-purpose hash | **Fast**                                                             | ❌ **Insecure** for passwords                                 |
| **bcrypt**  | Password hash        | **Slow** (configurable cost factor), includes salting                | ✅ **Good** - Industry standard for years                     |
| **scrypt**  | Password hash        | **Memory-Hard** (resists GPU attacks)                                | ✅ **Better** - Good choice                                   |
| **Argon2**  | Password hash        | **Memory-Hard** & configurable parallelism (resists custom hardware) | ✅ **Best** - Winner of the 2015 Password Hashing Competition |

We are using **bcrypt** because it's battle-tested, secure, and well-supported by `passlib`.

  - OWASP Password Storage Cheat Sheet: [https://cheatsheetseries.owasp.org/cheatsheets/Password_Storage_Cheat_Sheet.html](https://cheatsheetseries.owasp.org/cheatsheets/Password_Storage_Cheat_Sheet.html)

#### 🏋️ Practice Exercise: Hashing Speed Test

This exercise will prove why `bcrypt` is superior to `SHA-256` for passwords. Create a file `backend/hash_security_playground.py`. First, `pip install "passlib[bcrypt]"`.

```python
# backend/hash_security_playground.py
import time
from passlib.context import CryptContext
from hashlib import sha256

# Setup Passlib for bcrypt
pwd_context = CryptContext(schemes=["bcrypt"], deprecated="auto")
password = "my-super-secret-password-123"
iterations = 100

# --- Test 1: SHA-256 (The WRONG way) ---
print("--- Testing SHA-256 (Fast and Insecure) ---")
start_time = time.time()
for _ in range(iterations):
    # This is what you should NOT do. We are not even salting here.
    sha256(password.encode()).hexdigest()
end_time = time.time()
print(f"{iterations} SHA-256 hashes took: {end_time - start_time:.6f} seconds.\n")

# --- Test 2: bcrypt (The RIGHT way) ---
print("--- Testing bcrypt (Slow and Secure) ---")
start_time = time.time()
for _ in range(iterations):
    # Passlib handles salting and the slow hashing process.
    pwd_context.hash(password)
end_time = time.time()
print(f"{iterations} bcrypt hashes took: {end_time - start_time:.4f} seconds.")
print("Notice how bcrypt is orders of magnitude slower. This is a security feature!")
```

Run `python hash_security_playground.py`. You'll see that bcrypt is thousands of times slower. That slowness is what protects your users from brute-force attacks.

## 5.3: PKI and Digital Certificates - A Deep Dive

**PKI (Public Key Infrastructure)** is the framework of hardware, software, and policies that lets you create, manage, and revoke **digital certificates**. It's the system that underlies all of HTTPS and secure communication on the web.

### Core Concept: Asymmetric Cryptography

PKI is built on **asymmetric cryptography**, also known as public-key cryptography.

- You generate a **key pair**: a **private key** and a **public key**.
- The **Private Key** is kept absolutely secret. It's like your personal signature.
- The **Public Key** can be shared with anyone. It's like a public lock that only your private key can open.

**How it works for Digital Signatures:**

1.  You write a message (e.g., a JWT payload).
2.  You "sign" it by hashing the message and encrypting that hash with your **private key**. This creates a **digital signature**.
3.  You send the original message, your public key, and the signature to someone.
4.  They use your **public key** to decrypt the signature, revealing the original hash.
5.  They hash the message they received themselves.
6.  If their hash matches the decrypted hash, they have proven two things:
    - **Authentication**: The message could _only_ have come from you (since only your private key could create that signature).
    - **Integrity**: The message was not tampered with in transit (otherwise the hashes wouldn't match).

### Certificates and the Chain of Trust

But how does someone trust that your public key actually belongs to you? That's where **certificates** and **Certificate Authorities (CAs)** come in.

- A **Certificate** is a digital document that binds a public key to an identity (like `pdm-app.com`).
- A **Certificate Authority (CA)** is a trusted third party (like Verisign or Let's Encrypt) that verifies your identity and then signs your certificate with _their_ private key.

This creates a **Chain of Trust**. Your browser has a pre-installed list of trusted Root CAs. When it receives your server's certificate, it checks:

1.  Is this certificate signed by a CA I trust?
2.  If not, is the CA that signed it _itself_ signed by a CA I trust?
3.  ...and so on, up to a Root CA.

If the chain is valid, your browser displays the 🔒 lock icon. If not, it shows a security warning. This entire system is the PKI. We will use it directly when we implement HTTPS in Stage 12.

---

## 5.4: JSON Web Tokens (JWTs) & Common Vulnerabilities

As discussed in Stage 5, a JWT is our user's digital passport. Now let's dive deeper into its security.

### Symmetric vs. Asymmetric Signatures (HS256 vs. RS256)

We are using the **HS256** algorithm.

- **HS256 (HMAC with SHA-256)** is a **symmetric** algorithm. It uses a single secret key to both sign and verify tokens. This is simple and efficient, and it's perfect for our monolithic application where the same server creates and validates the tokens.

In a microservices architecture, you might use **RS256**.

- **RS256 (RSA Signature with SHA-256)** is an **asymmetric** algorithm. It uses a **private key** to sign tokens and a corresponding **public key** to verify them.
- **Use Case**: An Authentication service holds the private key and issues tokens. Dozens of other microservices can be given the public key to validate tokens without needing access to the highly sensitive private key.

### Common JWT Vulnerabilities and Mitigations

1.  **`alg: none` Attack**: An attacker modifies the JWT header to `{"alg": "none"}` and submits it. A poorly implemented library might see "none" and skip signature verification entirely, accepting the token.

    - **Mitigation**: The `python-jose` library protects against this. The `jwt.decode` function requires an `algorithms` argument (e.g., `algorithms=[ALGORITHM]`). If the token's `alg` header doesn't match what's in this list, it will be rejected.

2.  **Weak Secret Key**: If you use a short or predictable `SECRET_KEY` for HS256, an attacker can brute-force it.

    - **Mitigation**: Always use a long, randomly generated secret key with high entropy. In production, this should be loaded from a secure environment variable or secrets manager.

3.  **Token Hijacking (XSS)**: If your site has a Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerability, an attacker can inject JavaScript to steal the JWT from `localStorage`.

    - **Mitigation**:
      - **Primary**: Prevent XSS by properly sanitizing all user input (which FastAPI helps with).
      - **Secondary**: Use `httpOnly` cookies instead of `localStorage`. An `httpOnly` cookie is sent automatically with every request but cannot be accessed by client-side JavaScript, making it immune to theft via XSS. The trade-off is increased vulnerability to CSRF attacks, which require their own mitigations.

## 5.5: Python and the OWASP Top 10

The **OWASP (Open Web Application Security Project) Top 10** is a globally recognized document that lists the most critical security risks to web applications. Building a secure application means understanding and mitigating these risks. Our framework and practices already help us with many of them.

- **Further Reading**:
  - OWASP Top 10 List: [https://owasp.org/www-project-top-ten/](https://owasp.org/www-project-top-ten/)

| OWASP Risk                                          | How We Mitigate It in Our PDM App                                                                                                                                                                                                |
| :-------------------------------------------------- | :------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **A01: Broken Access Control**                      | We are implementing this in this stage\! Our `require_role` dependencies and `check_file_ownership` function are the core of our access control logic.                                                                           |
| **A02: Cryptographic Failures**                     | We are using `bcrypt` (a strong, slow algorithm) for passwords and `python-jose` (a standard, vetted library) for JWTs. We are **never "rolling our own crypto,"** which is the \#1 cause of this vulnerability.                 |
| **A03: Injection**                                  | FastAPI's use of Pydantic for data validation helps prevent many forms of injection. When we add a database in Stage 11, SQLAlchemy will use **parameterized queries**, which is the standard defense against **SQL Injection**. |
| **A05: Security Misconfiguration**                  | We're mitigating this by using environment variables for secrets and not running in debug mode in production.                                                                                                                    |
| **A07: Identification and Authentication Failures** | We're addressing this with our robust password hashing policy, secure login flow, and JWT-based session management.                                                                                                              |

---

## 5.6: Final Implementation

Now, let's proceed with the code implementation from the previous Stage 5 response. This includes:

1.  Installing `passlib` and `python-jose`.
2.  Creating the user management functions and JWT helpers.
3.  Adding the `/login` endpoint.
4.  Creating the `get_current_user` dependency.
5.  Protecting the `/api/files` endpoint.
6.  Building the frontend login page and updating the main `app.js` to handle tokens and logout.

Follow the code blocks from the previous Stage 5 response to build out this functionality. The deep dives above provide the critical "why" behind each piece of code.

### Stage 5 Complete - A Secure Foundation\!

You have now built a complete and secure authentication system. More importantly, you have a deep understanding of the cryptographic principles and security best practices that make it trustworthy.

### What's Next?

We will build directly on this foundation. In the next stage you chose, **Stage 6**, we will use the `role` we embedded in our JWT to implement fine-grained **Authorization**, building out our admin-only features and a full audit trail.

You are absolutely right. The deep dives were a valuable prelude, but we haven't implemented the code for Stage 5 in our step-by-step, muscle-memory-building way. My apologies for jumping ahead.

Let's get back on track and build out the authentication and authorization features for Stage 5 from scratch, piece by piece. We'll break it down into small, manageable steps so you can type the code and see the changes as we go.

Here is the original **Stage 5**, reformatted into the incremental style you prefer.

---

# Stage 5: Implementing Authentication & Authorization

## Introduction: The Goal of This Stage

Right now, our app is open to everyone. This stage is dedicated to securing it. We will build a complete login system from the ground up, ensuring that only authenticated users can access the application's data. We will also introduce the concept of user roles, which is the foundation for authorization (controlling _what_ users can do).

---

## 5.1: Installing the Security Libraries

First, we need two key Python libraries: one for secure password hashing and one for handling JSON Web Tokens (JWTs).

**In your activated virtual environment, run:**

```bash
pip install "passlib[bcrypt]" "python-jose[cryptography]"
```

- `passlib[bcrypt]`: The industry-standard library for password hashing. We specify `[bcrypt]` because it's a deliberately slow and secure algorithm, perfect for passwords.
- `python-jose[cryptography]`: A robust library for creating, signing, and validating the JWTs that will act as our users' "digital passports."

After they are installed, update your `requirements.txt` file to lock in these new dependencies.

```bash
pip freeze > requirements.txt
```

---

## 5.2: Setting Up Password Hashing

We'll start by adding the configuration for `passlib` to our application. This tells our app how to hash and verify passwords.

**Add this code to the top of `backend/main.py`:**

```python
# Add this import at the top of main.py
from passlib.context import CryptContext

# Add this configuration block right after your imports
# This creates a context for hashing, specifying the schemes to use.
# 'deprecated="auto"' tells passlib to automatically handle updating old hashes if we ever change schemes.
pwd_context = CryptContext(schemes=["bcrypt"], deprecated="auto")
```

---

## 5.3: Creating User Management Functions

Now, we'll create a set of helper functions to manage our user data. For this stage, we'll store users in a `users.json` file inside our `git_repo`. This file will act as our simple user database.

### **Step 1: Update Path Constants**

First, let's define the path to our new `users.json` file.

**Add this line to the path definitions in `main.py`:**

```python
# In main.py, near the other path constants
USERS_FILE = GIT_REPO_PATH / 'users.json'
```

### **Step 2: Add the User Helper Functions**

This block of code contains all the logic for creating, loading, saving, and authenticating users. It's the "repository" for our user data.

**Add this entire block of code to `main.py`:**

```python
# --- User Management Functions ---

def verify_password(plain_password: str, hashed_password: str) -> bool:
    """Verifies a plain-text password against a hash using our configured context."""
    return pwd_context.verify(plain_password, hashed_password)

def get_user(username: str) -> dict | None:
    """Retrieves a single user by username from the user 'database'."""
    if not USERS_FILE.exists():
        return None
    with open(USERS_FILE, 'r') as f:
        users = json.load(f)
    return users.get(username)

def save_users(users: dict, commit_user: str, commit_message: str):
    """Saves the user dictionary to users.json and creates a Git commit."""
    save_data_with_commit(USERS_FILE, users, commit_user, commit_message)

def create_default_users():
    """Creates default admin and test user if users.json is empty or doesn't exist."""
    if USERS_FILE.exists():
        with open(USERS_FILE, 'r') as f:
            if f.read().strip() != '{}':
                return # Users already exist

    logger.info("Creating default users: 'admin' and 'john'")
    users = {
        "admin": {
            "username": "admin",
            "password_hash": pwd_context.hash("admin123"),
            "full_name": "Administrator",
            "role": "admin"
        },
        "john": {
            "username": "john",
            "password_hash": pwd_context.hash("password123"),
            "full_name": "John Doe",
            "role": "user"
        }
    }
    save_users(users, "system", "Create default users")

def authenticate_user(username: str, password: str) -> dict | None:
    """
    Authenticates a user. If successful, returns the user's data.
    Otherwise, returns None.
    """
    user = get_user(username)
    if not user or not verify_password(password, user["password_hash"]):
        return None
    return user
```

### **Step 3: Call `create_default_users` on Startup**

We need to make sure our default users are created when the app starts.

**Modify the `startup_event` function in `main.py`:**

```python
@app.on_event("startup")
def startup_event():
    """Code to run when the application starts up."""
    global git_repo
    git_repo = initialize_git_repo()
    create_default_users() # Add this line
```

**Checkpoint:** Restart your server. Check your `backend/git_repo` directory. You should now see a `users.json` file populated with the hashed passwords for the `admin` and `john` users.

---

## 5.4: Configuring and Implementing JWTs

Now we'll set up the logic for creating and validating the JWTs that will serve as our users' authentication tokens.

### **Step 1: Add JWT Configuration and Pydantic Models**

**Add this block of code to `main.py`:**

```python
# --- JWT & Auth Configuration ---
from datetime import datetime, timedelta, timezone
from jose import JWTError, jwt
from fastapi import Depends, HTTPException, status
from fastapi.security import OAuth2PasswordBearer, OAuth2PasswordRequestForm
from pydantic import BaseModel
from typing import Optional

SECRET_KEY = settings.SECRET_KEY
ALGORITHM = settings.ALGORITHM
ACCESS_TOKEN_EXPIRE_MINUTES = settings.ACCESS_TOKEN_EXPIRE_MINUTES

# This dependency extracts the token from the "Authorization: Bearer <token>" header
oauth2_scheme = OAuth2PasswordBearer(tokenUrl="/api/auth/login")

# Pydantic models to define the shape of our auth-related data
class Token(BaseModel):
    access_token: str
    token_type: str

class User(BaseModel):
    username: str
    full_name: str
    role: str
```

### **Step 2: Add the `create_access_token` Function**

This function will generate a signed JWT for a user after they log in.

**Add this function to `main.py`:**

```python
def create_access_token(data: dict, expires_delta: timedelta):
    """Creates a new JWT."""
    to_encode = data.copy()
    expire = datetime.now(timezone.utc) + expires_delta
    to_encode.update({"exp": expire})
    # This is the core of JWT creation: encoding the payload with a secret key and algorithm
    encoded_jwt = jwt.encode(to_encode, SECRET_KEY, algorithm=ALGORITHM)
    return encoded_jwt
```

---

## 5.5: Building the Login Endpoint

This is the public endpoint that users will send their credentials to in exchange for a token.

**Add this endpoint to `main.py`:**

```python
@app.post("/api/auth/login", response_model=Token)
def login_for_access_token(form_data: OAuth2PasswordRequestForm = Depends()):
    # 1. Authenticate the user using our helper function
    user = authenticate_user(form_data.username, form_data.password)
    if not user:
        # If authentication fails, raise a 401 Unauthorized error.
        # It's crucial to use a generic error message to prevent "username enumeration" attacks.
        raise HTTPException(
            status_code=status.HTTP_401_UNAUTHORIZED,
            detail="Incorrect username or password",
            headers={"WWW-Authenticate": "Bearer"},
        )

    # 2. Create the JWT for the authenticated user
    access_token_expires = timedelta(minutes=ACCESS_TOKEN_EXPIRE_MINUTES)
    access_token = create_access_token(
        # The JWT "payload". "sub" (subject) is the standard claim for the user's ID.
        # We also add our custom "role" claim.
        data={"sub": user["username"], "role": user["role"]},
        expires_delta=access_token_expires
    )

    # 3. Return the token to the client
    return {"access_token": access_token, "token_type": "bearer"}
```

- **`OAuth2PasswordRequestForm = Depends()`**: This special dependency tells FastAPI to expect the username and password as form data (`application/x-www-form-urlencoded`), which is part of the OAuth2 standard for this type of login flow.

**Checkpoint:** Restart your server. You can now test your login endpoint\! Use `curl` to simulate a form submission.

```powershell
# In PowerShell
curl -X POST http://localhost:8000/api/auth/login -H "Content-Type: application/x-www-form-urlencoded" -d "username=admin&password=admin123"
```

You should get a JSON response containing a long `access_token`. Now try it with the wrong password to see the `401 Unauthorized` error.

---

## 5.6: Protecting API Endpoints

Now that users can get a token, we need a way to demand it. We'll create a dependency that all protected endpoints will use.

### **Step 1: Create the `get_current_user` Dependency**

This function will be our "gatekeeper." It extracts the token from the request, validates it, and returns the corresponding user.

**Add this function to `main.py`:**

```python
async def get_current_user(token: str = Depends(oauth2_scheme)) -> User:
    """
    Dependency to get the current user from a JWT.
    This will be used to protect endpoints.
    """
    credentials_exception = HTTPException(
        status_code=status.HTTP_401_UNAUTHORIZED,
        detail="Could not validate credentials",
        headers={"WWW-Authenticate": "Bearer"},
    )
    try:
        # The decode function validates the signature and expiration time.
        payload = jwt.decode(token, SECRET_KEY, algorithms=[ALGORITHM])
        username: str = payload.get("sub")
        if username is None:
            raise credentials_exception
    except JWTError:
        raise credentials_exception

    user_dict = get_user(username=username)
    if user_dict is None:
        # This handles cases where a user might have been deleted after a token was issued.
        raise credentials_exception

    return User(**user_dict)
```

### **Step 2: Apply the Protection**

Protecting an endpoint is now as simple as adding our new dependency to its signature.

**Update the `/api/files` endpoint in `main.py`:**

```python
# Find your get_files function and add the `Depends` part

@app.get("/api/files")
def get_files(current_user: User = Depends(get_current_user)): # <-- ADD THIS
    # If the code reaches this point, the user is authenticated.
    # `current_user` will be a Pydantic model containing the user's data.
    logger.info(f"User '{current_user.username}' is requesting the file list.")

    # ... the rest of the function remains the same ...
    locks = load_locks()
    files = []
    # ... etc ...
    return {"files": files}
```

**Checkpoint:** Restart the server.

- Try `curl http://localhost:8000/api/files`. It should fail with a `401 Unauthorized` error.
- Now, get a fresh token from the login endpoint and use it:

  ```powershell
  # Get the token (this command is for PowerShell)
  $token = (curl -X POST http://localhost:8000/api/auth/login -H "Content-Type: application/x-www-form-urlencoded" -d "username=admin&password=admin123" | ConvertFrom-Json).access_token

  # Use the token in the Authorization header
  curl http://localhost:8000/api/files -H "Authorization: Bearer $token"
  ```

  This request should now succeed\! You have successfully protected your endpoint. Apply this `Depends(get_current_user)` pattern to all other endpoints that should not be public.

---

## 5.7: Building the Frontend Login Flow

Now let's build the UI for logging in.

### **Step 1: Create the HTML, CSS, and JS Files**

- Create `backend/static/login.html`.
- Create `backend/static/js/login.js`.
- Add the login page-specific styles to `backend/static/css/components.css`.

(Copy the full code for these three parts from my previous detailed response to avoid repetition here).

### **Step 2: Add the Endpoint to Serve the Login Page**

**Add this endpoint to `main.py`:**

```python
@app.get("/login", response_class=FileResponse)
async def serve_login_page():
    """Serves the login.html page."""
    return "static/login.html"
```

### **Step 3: Protect the Main App and Handle Logout**

- **Auth Guard:** Add the self-executing script to the `<head>` of `index.html` to redirect unauthenticated users to `/login`.
- **Send Token:** Update all your `fetch` calls in `app.js` to include the `Authorization: Bearer <token>` header.
- **Logout Button:** Add the logout button to `index.html` and its `click` handler to `app.js` to clear `localStorage` and redirect.

(These are small but critical pieces of code, also available in the previous full response).

---

## Stage 5 Complete - A Secure Application\!

You have now implemented a complete, professional authentication system. You've learned about secure password storage, the mechanics of JWTs, and how to protect API endpoints using FastAPI's dependency injection system.

### Verification Checklist

- [ ] Attempting to access the main page (`/`) without logging in redirects you to `/login`.
- [ ] You can log in with the default `admin` or `john` user.
- [ ] After logging in, the access token is stored in `localStorage` and you are redirected to the main app.
- [ ] The file list loads correctly, and you can see the `Authorization` header being sent in the DevTools Network tab.
- [ ] Clicking the "Logout" button clears the token and sends you back to the login page.

### What's Next?

Now that we know _who_ our users are, we can control _what_ they can do. In **Stage 6**, we'll use the `role` claim in our JWT to implement **Role-Based Access Control (RBAC)**, building out admin-only features and a full audit trail.

That's an excellent architectural consideration to bring up now. You're thinking like a software engineer, planning for different deployment scenarios from the start. Yes, this is exactly the right time to discuss this, as it directly impacts how we handle shared state like user data and file locks.

The good news is that the architecture we are building is **inherently flexible** and will support both of your desired models. Let's define them clearly:

1.  **Model A (Standalone / Distributed):** Each user runs the full FastAPI server on their own machine. The `git_repo` is a local clone. Collaboration happens **asynchronously** by pushing and pulling changes to a central remote (like GitLab). A lock Alice places on her machine is only visible to Bob after she pushes and he pulls.
2.  **Model B (Centralized Server):** One single FastAPI server runs on a dedicated machine. All users connect to it through their browsers. There is only one `git_repo` on that server. Collaboration is **real-time**, and a lock is instantly visible to everyone.

The code we will write in this stage for authorization will work for **both models**. The logic (`require_admin`, `check_file_ownership`) operates on the state _as the server sees it at that moment_. The difference is how that state gets synchronized, which is a topic we'll master in Stage 7 (Git) and Stage 9 (WebSockets).

Let's build out our authorization logic with this flexibility in mind.

---

# Stage 6: Role-Based Access Control (RBAC) & Authorization (Expanded & Unified)

## Introduction: The Goal of This Stage

In Stage 5, we answered "Who are you?" with **authentication**. Now, in Stage 6, we answer "What are you allowed to do?" with **authorization**. We'll implement a Role-Based Access Control (RBAC) system to ensure users can only perform actions appropriate for their role.

This is where we enforce business rules and secure sensitive operations, a critical step in building a trustworthy application.

---

### **🧠 Foundational Concepts: A Deeper Look**

- **Time Investment:** 5-7 hours.
- **Software Engineering Principle: Principle of Least Privilege**. This is the guiding star for this entire stage. Every user or system component should only have the bare minimum permissions required to do its job. We don't give a regular user delete permissions "just in case." This principle dramatically reduces the "blast radius" if an account is ever compromised.
- **CS Topic: Authorization Models**. We are implementing **RBAC** (Role-Based Access Control), which is simple and powerful. Another model is **ABAC** (Attribute-Based Access Control), which uses flexible rules based on attributes (e.g., `allow checkout if user.department == file.department AND time is 9-5`). Our "ownership check" is a simple form of ABAC.

---

## 6.1: Creating a Role-Based Dependency

To protect our endpoints, we need a reusable "gatekeeper" that checks a user's role. In FastAPI, we do this by creating a **dependency**. Because we might want to check for different roles (`admin`, `editor`, etc.), we'll build a "dependency factory"—a function that creates these gatekeeper dependencies for us.

### **Step 1: The `require_role` Factory**

This is a clever and powerful pattern. It's a higher-order function that takes a list of allowed roles and returns a dependency function configured with those roles.

**Add this code to `backend/main.py`:**

```python
# Add this import at the top
from typing import List

# Add this block of code after your `get_current_user` dependency
# --- Authorization Dependencies ---

def require_role(allowed_roles: List[str]):
    """
    This is a dependency factory. It returns a dependency function that
    will check if the current user's role is in the allowed_roles list.
    """
    # This is the actual dependency function that will be injected into our endpoints
    async def role_checker(current_user: User = Depends(get_current_user)) -> User:
        # Check if the authenticated user's role is in the list we provided
        if current_user.role not in allowed_roles:
            logger.warning(
                f"Authorization Failed: User '{current_user.username}' with role '{current_user.role}' "
                f"attempted to access a resource restricted to roles: {allowed_roles}"
            )
            # 403 Forbidden is the correct status code for an authenticated user
            # who lacks the necessary permissions for a specific action.
            raise HTTPException(
                status_code=status.HTTP_403_FORBIDDEN,
                detail="You do not have permission to perform this action."
            )
        # If the check passes, return the user object for the endpoint to use
        return current_user

    return role_checker

# --- Convenience Aliases ---
# We can now create specific dependencies for common use cases. This makes our endpoint code cleaner.
require_admin = require_role(["admin"])
require_any_user = require_role(["admin", "user"]) # Anyone who is logged in
```

---

## 6.2: Creating an Admin-Only Endpoint

Now let's use our new `require_admin` dependency to build a dangerous, admin-only feature: deleting a file.

### **Step 1: The `delete_file` Endpoint**

**Add this new endpoint to `main.py`:**

```python
# Add this new endpoint to main.py

@app.delete("/api/admin/files/{filename}", status_code=status.HTTP_204_NO_CONTENT)
def delete_file(
    filename: str,
    current_user: User = Depends(require_admin) # <-- This is our security gate!
):
    """
    Deletes a file from the repository. This is a destructive, admin-only action.
    """
    logger.warning(
        f"ADMIN ACTION: User '{current_user.username}' is requesting to DELETE file '{filename}'."
    )

    file_path = REPO_PATH / filename
    if not file_path.exists():
        # Even for an admin, if the file isn't there, it's a 404.
        raise HTTPException(status_code=404, detail="File not found.")

    # --- Business Logic: Admin Override ---
    # An admin should be able to delete a file even if it's currently locked.
    locks = load_locks()
    if filename in locks:
        logger.warning(f"Admin is deleting a file that was locked by '{locks[filename]['user']}'.")
        del locks[filename]
        commit_msg = f"Admin force-removed lock on {filename} for deletion"
        save_locks(locks, current_user.username, commit_msg)

    try:
        os.remove(file_path) # The actual file deletion

        # We need a commit to record the file deletion in Git history
        commit_msg = f"Delete file: {filename}"
        git_repo.index.remove([str(file_path.relative_to(GIT_REPO_PATH))])
        author = Actor(current_user.username, f"{current_user.username}@pdm.local")
        git_repo.index.commit(commit_msg, author=author, committer=author)

        logger.info(f"File '{filename}' permanently deleted by admin '{current_user.username}'.")

        # A 204 response means "Success, but there is no content to send back."
        return Response(status_code=status.HTTP_204_NO_CONTENT)
    except Exception as e:
        logger.error(f"Error during file deletion: {e}")
        raise HTTPException(status_code=500, detail="Failed to delete file.")
```

- **Architectural Note:** In your **Standalone/Distributed model**, this action deletes the file and creates a commit on the admin's local repository. Other users won't see the file disappear until the admin runs `git push` and they run `git pull`. In the **Centralized model**, this action is immediate and affects everyone.

### **Step 2: Add Delete Button to the Frontend**

Now, we'll add a delete button to the UI that is **only visible to admins**.

**Update the `createFileElement` function in `app.js`:**

```javascript
// In app.js, find the createFileElement function
function createFileElement(file) {
  // ... (existing code to create infoDiv and actionsDiv)

  const userRole = localStorage.getItem("user_role");

  // ... (existing if/else block for checkout/checkin buttons)

  // --- Conditionally Render the Delete Button ---
  // This is UI/UX, not security. The real security is on the server.
  if (userRole === "admin") {
    const deleteBtn = document.createElement("button");
    deleteBtn.className = "btn btn-danger"; // A new style we need to add
    deleteBtn.textContent = "Delete";
    deleteBtn.onclick = () => handleDelete(file.name);
    actionsDiv.appendChild(deleteBtn);
  }

  // ... (rest of the function)
}
```

**Add the `handleDelete` function to `app.js`:**

```javascript
// Add this new handler function to app.js
async function handleDelete(filename) {
  // It's good practice to ask for confirmation for destructive actions.
  if (
    !confirm(
      `Are you sure you want to permanently delete "${filename}"? This cannot be undone.`
    )
  ) {
    return;
  }

  try {
    const token = localStorage.getItem("access_token");
    const response = await fetch(`/api/admin/files/${filename}`, {
      method: "DELETE",
      headers: { Authorization: `Bearer ${token}` },
    });

    if (response.status === 204) {
      showNotification(`File '${filename}' deleted successfully.`, "success");
      loadFiles(); // Refresh the file list
    } else {
      const errorData = await response.json();
      throw new Error(errorData.detail);
    }
  } catch (error) {
    showNotification(`Error: ${error.message}`, "error");
    console.error("Delete failed:", error);
  }
}
```

**Add the CSS for the danger button to `components.css`:**

```css
.btn-danger {
  background: var(--status-danger);
  color: var(--text-inverse);
}
.btn-danger:hover {
  background: var(--color-danger-600);
}
```

**Checkpoint:** Log in as a regular user (`john`). You should **not** see any delete buttons. Now, log out and log in as an `admin`. You should see the red delete buttons. Try deleting a file to test the full flow.

---

## 6.3: Audit Logging

For security and compliance, every sensitive action must be logged. An audit log provides an immutable trail of who did what, and when.

### **Step 1: Implement the Audit Log Functions**

First, create an empty `audit_log.json` file in your `backend/git_repo` directory.

**Create `backend/git_repo/audit_log.json`:**

```json
[]
```

**Now, add these functions to `main.py`:**

```python
# Add this import to the top of main.py
import uuid

# --- Audit Logging Functions ---

def log_audit_event(user: str, action: str, target: str, details: dict = None):
    """Appends a structured, timestamped event to the audit log."""
    event = {
        "id": str(uuid.uuid4()), # A unique, unguessable ID for this event
        "timestamp": datetime.now(timezone.utc).isoformat(), # Standard ISO 8601 format
        "user": user,
        "action": action.upper(), # Standardize action names
        "target": target,
        "details": details or {}
    }

    try:
        # This operation MUST be atomic to be reliable in a multi-user environment
        with LockedFile(AUDIT_LOG_FILE, 'r+') as f:
            # r+ opens the file for both reading and writing
            log_data = json.load(f)
            log_data.append(event)
            f.seek(0) # Rewind the file to the beginning
            f.truncate() # Clear the file content
            json.dump(log_data, f, indent=2) # Write the new, updated list

        logger.info(f"AUDIT: {event}")
    except Exception as e:
        logger.error(f"CRITICAL: FAILED TO WRITE TO AUDIT LOG! Error: {e}")

@app.get("/api/admin/audit-log", response_model=List[dict])
def get_audit_log_endpoint(current_user: User = Depends(require_admin)):
    """Admin-only endpoint to retrieve the audit log."""
    logger.info(f"Admin '{current_user.username}' accessed the audit log.")

    # We use our atomic lock here too to prevent reading a partially-written file
    with LockedFile(AUDIT_LOG_FILE, 'r') as f:
        logs = json.load(f)
        return sorted(logs, key=lambda x: x['timestamp'], reverse=True)
```

- **CS Topic (Atomicity):** The `r+`, `seek(0)`, `truncate()`, `dump()` sequence inside our `LockedFile` context manager ensures the audit log update is atomic. If the server crashed mid-write, we wouldn't be left with a corrupted, half-written JSON file.

### **Step 2: Add Audit Calls to Endpoints**

Now, go back to your sensitive endpoints and add calls to `log_audit_event`.

- In `delete_file`:
  ```python
  log_audit_event(
      user=current_user.username,
      action="DELETE_FILE",
      target=filename,
      details={"was_locked": was_locked}
  )
  ```
- In `checkin_file`:
  ```python
  # Determine if it was a force-checkin by an admin
  was_forced = locks[request.filename]['user'] != current_user.username
  log_audit_event(
      user=current_user.username,
      action="CHECKIN_FILE",
      target=request.filename,
      details={"forced": was_forced}
  )
  ```
- Add similar calls to `checkout_file` and `upload_file`.

---

## Stage 6 Complete - A Secure & Auditable Application\!

You have successfully implemented a robust authorization layer. Your application now differentiates between user roles, enforces permissions, and logs all sensitive actions.

### Verification Checklist

- [ ] Regular users (`john`) cannot see the "Delete" button.
- [ ] Logging in as `admin` makes the "Delete" button and "Admin Panel" link visible.
- [ ] A regular user cannot check in a file locked by another user.
- [ ] An admin **can** check in a file locked by another user (force check-in).
- [ ] Deleting a file or forcing a check-in creates a detailed entry in `audit_log.json`.
- [ ] Attempting to call the `/api/admin/delete/...` or `/api/admin/audit-log` endpoints as a regular user results in a `403 Forbidden` error.

### What's Next?

We've mentioned Git commits throughout this stage. In **Stage 7**, we will fully integrate Git as our data backend, replacing our `save_locks` and other file writes with `git commit`. This will give us a complete, indestructible version history for our entire application state.

Excellent. This is the perfect time for a deep dive. To make your PDM application truly powerful, you need to understand Git at a fundamental level—not just as a series of commands to memorize, but as a conceptual model for managing history.

Before we integrate Git into our Python code in Stage 7, let's spend some quality time in the command line to build that expert-level intuition. This prelude will be your Git boot camp. We'll go from the absolute basics to advanced "time travel" commands that give professional developers their confidence.

I'll be sure to include plenty of resource links and connect the commands to the underlying computer science principles.

---

# Prelude to Stage 7: A Deep Dive into Git

## Part 1: The Core Philosophy - Why Git is a Time Machine

At its heart, Git is a tool for **version control**. Think about how you might do this manually:

`pdm_app_v1.py`
`pdm_app_v2_final.py`
`pdm_app_v2_final_REALLY_final.py`

This is chaotic, error-prone, and doesn't scale. Git solves this by creating a reliable, structured history of your project.

### The Key Idea: A System of Snapshots

The most important concept to grasp is that **Git thinks about its data as a stream of snapshots**. It doesn't store a list of file-by-file changes (deltas), as older systems did. When you make a commit, Git essentially takes a picture of what all your files look like at that moment and stores a reference to that snapshot.

### The Commit Hash: A Unique Fingerprint

Every snapshot (commit) in Git is identified by a unique 40-character string called a **SHA-1 hash** (e.g., `e1b2b3b4d5...`). This hash is generated based on the contents of the files in the commit, the metadata (author, timestamp), and the hash of the _previous_ commit.

This creates a linked, tamper-proof chain. If you were to go back and change even a single character in an old file, the hash of that commit would change, which would cause the hash of _every subsequent commit_ to change. This cryptographic chain is what makes your project history secure and verifiable.

- **Further Reading**:
  - **The Pro Git Book**: This is the definitive, free online book on Git. We'll link to specific chapters. Chapter 10, "Git Internals," is a fantastic deep dive. [https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2](https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2)

---

## Part 2: The Essential Workflow - Your First Commits

Let's build some muscle memory with the commands you'll use every day. Open your terminal in a new, empty folder called `git-playground`.

### Step 1: Configuration (Do this once)

First, tell Git who you are. This information will be baked into every commit you make.

```bash
git config --global user.name "Your Name"
git config --global user.email "your.email@example.com"
```

### Step 2: The Three Trees - `init`, `add`, `commit`

Git manages three "trees" or areas:

1.  **Working Directory**: The actual files on your disk.
2.  **Staging Area (or Index)**: A "drafting" area where you prepare your next snapshot.
3.  **Repository (`.git` directory)**: The permanent, immutable history of all your commits.

Let's see this in action:

```bash
# 1. Create a new repository. This creates the hidden .git directory.
git init

# 2. Create a file in your Working Directory.
echo "Project Title" > project.txt

# 3. Check the status. Git sees a new, "untracked" file.
git status
# Output: On branch main, No commits yet, Untracked files: (use "git add <file>..." to include in what will be committed) project.txt

# 4. Add the file to the Staging Area. This tells Git you want to include this change in your next snapshot.
git add project.txt

# 5. Check the status again. The file is now staged.
git status
# Output: On branch main, No commits yet, Changes to be committed: (use "git rm --cached <file>..." to unstage) new file: project.txt

# 6. Commit the staged changes to the Repository. This creates a permanent snapshot with your message.
git commit -m "Initial commit: Add project file"
# Output: [main (root-commit) 1a2b3c4] Initial commit: Add project file

# Now, your working directory is "clean" because it matches the latest commit.
git status
# Output: On branch main, nothing to commit, working tree clean
```

### Step 3: Viewing History with `git log`

The `git log` command is your window into the project's history.

```bash
# See the full history
git log

# A more concise, useful view
git log --oneline --graph --all
```

- `--oneline`: Shows each commit on a single line (hash and message).
- `--graph`: Draws a text-based graph of the commit history.
- `--all`: Shows all branches, not just the current one.

---

## Part 3: Branching and Merging - Parallel Universes

**Branching is Git's killer feature.** A branch is simply a lightweight, movable pointer to a commit. It allows you to create a separate line of development to work on a new feature without affecting your stable `main` branch.

### The Branching Workflow

```bash
# 1. Create a new branch called 'new-feature'
git branch new-feature

# 2. Switch to your new branch. Your "HEAD" (current location) is now on 'new-feature'.
git checkout new-feature
# Pro Tip: You can create and switch in one command with `git checkout -b new-feature`

# 3. Make a change.
echo "A new feature" >> project.txt

# 4. Commit the change. This commit is ONLY on the 'new-feature' branch.
git add project.txt
git commit -m "FEAT: Add new feature"

# 5. Switch back to main. Notice that your change disappears from project.txt! You've traveled back in time.
git checkout main

# 6. Merge the feature branch into main to bring the changes in.
git merge new-feature

# Now project.txt has the "A new feature" line, and your main branch has the new commit.
```

### The Inevitable: Merge Conflicts

A conflict happens when you make different changes to the **same lines** of the same file on two different branches. Git can't know which change is correct, so it stops and asks you to resolve it.

**How to resolve a conflict (don't be scared\!):**

1.  Run `git merge ...`. Git will tell you there's a conflict.
2.  Run `git status`. It will show you which files are conflicted.
3.  Open the conflicted file. You will see markers like this:
    ```
    <<<<<<< HEAD
    This is the change from your current branch (e.g., main).
    =======
    This is the change from the branch you're trying to merge.
    >>>>>>> new-feature
    ```
4.  **Edit the file.** Delete the `<<<<<<<`, `=======`, and `>>>>>>>` markers and edit the text to be the final version you want. You can choose one version, the other, or a combination of both.
5.  Save the file.
6.  `git add <the-resolved-file>`
7.  `git commit` (You don't need a message; Git provides a default one for merges).

That's it\! You've resolved a conflict. It's a normal part of collaborative development.

---

## Part 4: Working with Remotes - Collaboration

A **remote** is a version of your repository hosted on a server like GitLab or GitHub. It's the central point for your team to share work.

- **`git clone <url>`**: Downloads a repository from a remote server to your local machine.
- **`git remote add <name> <url>`**: Adds a new remote (conventionally named `origin`).
- **`git push <remote> <branch>`**: Uploads your local branch's commits to the remote.
- **`git fetch <remote>`**: Downloads changes from the remote but does **not** merge them into your working directory. This lets you see what's new without affecting your current work.
- **`git pull <remote> <branch>`**: This is a shortcut for `git fetch` followed by `git merge`. It downloads changes _and_ merges them into your current branch.

**Best Practice:** Many professionals prefer `git fetch` followed by a manual `git merge` or `git rebase` (see below) to have more control over how incoming changes are integrated.

## Part 5: The Expert's Toolkit - Time Travel & Polishing

These are the commands that separate an intermediate user from an expert. They give you the confidence to experiment, knowing you can always undo any mistake.

### Undoing Mistakes: Your Safety Net

| Command                        | What It Does                                                                            | When to Use It                                                                                                                                                                                         |
| :----------------------------- | :-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | :----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **`git commit --amend`**       | Rewrites your _most recent_ commit.                                                     | You made a typo in the last commit message or forgot to add a file.                                                                                                                                    |
| **`git revert <commit-hash>`** | Creates a **new commit** that is the exact inverse of a past commit.                    | You need to undo a public commit on a shared branch. This is the **safest** way to undo, as it doesn't rewrite history.                                                                                |
| **`git reset <commit-hash>`**  | **Moves the branch pointer** back to a previous commit, effectively "deleting" commits. | You need to undo local, private commits that you haven't pushed yet. **This rewrites history and is dangerous on shared branches.**                                                                    |
| **`git reflog`**               | Shows a log of every time `HEAD` has moved.                                             | **THE ULTIMATE SAFETY NET.** You accidentally ran `git reset --hard` and think you lost work. Run `git reflog`, find the hash of the commit you were on, and `git reset --hard <hash>` to get it back. |

### Rewriting History: `git rebase`

Rebasing is a powerful way to create a clean, linear history. Instead of a merge commit, it "re-plays" your branch's commits on top of the latest version of the `main` branch.

**Interactive Rebase (`git rebase -i`) is a superpower.** It lets you:

- **Squash**: Combine multiple small commits into one logical commit.
- **Reword**: Change commit messages.
- **Reorder**: Change the order of commits.

This is the key to presenting a clean, easy-to-review Pull Request.

> **The Golden Rule of Rebasing**: **NEVER rebase a public branch** (like `main` or any branch that other people are working on). Rebasing rewrites history. If you do it on a shared branch, you will cause massive problems for your collaborators. Only rebase your own local, private feature branches before merging them.

## Conclusion

This was a whirlwind tour, but you now have the conceptual framework and command-line skills to use Git like a professional. You understand that it's a system of snapshots, that branches are just pointers, and that you have powerful tools to manage and even rewrite your project's history with confidence.

With this foundation, you are now ready to start **Stage 7** and integrate this power directly into our PDM application.

Excellent. You're right to see this as a great opportunity. Learning to use a powerful library like `GitPython` is a huge step in graduating from coder to software engineer. It's not just about getting it to work; it's about understanding its design, how it maps to the concepts you already know (the Git CLI), and how to read its documentation to discover new capabilities.

I'm happy to go deeper in this stage. We'll treat `GitPython` as a case study in learning a new library. I'll break down its core classes and methods, explain how to think about them as Python objects, and connect every piece of code back to the command-line equivalent.

Let's begin the deep dive into **Stage 7**.

---

# Stage 7: Git Integration - A Deep Dive into `GitPython`

## Introduction: The Goal of This Stage

Our application's state is currently stored in simple JSON files. This is fragile. There's no history, no easy way to undo a mistake, and no clear audit trail of who changed what. In this stage, we will replace our direct file writes with a robust **Git repository**, managed directly from our Python code.

Every change—a file checkout, a user update, an audit log entry—will become an **atomic Git commit**. This gives us a complete, indestructible, and auditable version history for our entire application.

---

### **🧠 Foundational Concepts: A Deeper Look**

- **Time Investment:** 6-8 hours.
- **How to Read Library Documentation**: You mentioned that docs can feel like a refresher for people who already know the library. This is a common and frustrating experience\! The key is to find the **core objects** or **main classes**. For `GitPython`, the central object is the **`Repo`** class. Almost everything you do will start with an instance of this class. We'll explore its methods and attributes as we go. When you look at the docs, focus on the table of contents for these main classes first.
- **Design Pattern: Transactional State Changes**. By wrapping our state changes in a Git commit, we are creating a **transaction**. The operation either succeeds completely (the commit is made) or it fails, leaving the repository in its previous clean state. This prevents partial updates and data corruption.
- **Further Reading**:
  - **GitPython Documentation**: Keep this open in a tab. We'll be referring to it. [https://gitpython.readthedocs.io/en/stable/](https://gitpython.readthedocs.io/en/stable/)

---

## 7.1: Installing `GitPython` and Initial Setup

Let's add the library to our environment.

**In your activated virtual environment, run:**

```bash
pip install GitPython
pip freeze > requirements.txt
```

`GitPython` is a Python wrapper around your system's `git` command. It essentially runs `git` commands in the background and gives you the results as Python objects.

---

## 7.2: Understanding the `GitPython` Object Model

Before we write code, let's understand the main "characters" in the `GitPython` library. Thinking in terms of these objects will make the code much easier to understand.

- **`git.Repo`**: This is the main class. An **instance** of this class (e.g., `my_repo = Repo(...)`) is a Python object that represents your entire repository on disk. You'll use this object to access everything else.
- **`repo.index`**: This is an object representing the **Staging Area**. You'll use its methods, like `.add()` and `.commit()`, to build and finalize your snapshots.
- **`git.Actor`**: A simple object to represent a person (an author or committer), holding their name and email.
- **`git.Commit`**: An object representing a single commit. It contains the hash, message, author, parent commits, and a reference to the project's file tree at that point in time.
- **`repo.remote()`**: An object representing a remote repository (like `origin`). You'll use its methods, like `.push()` and `.pull()`, to communicate with GitLab.

---

## 7.3: Initializing the Repository on Startup

First, we need to ensure our application's data directory is a Git repository. We'll create a function that runs when the server starts up.

### **Step 1: Update Path Constants**

We need to create a new top-level directory for our Git repository and update our paths in `main.py` to point inside it.

**In `main.py`, find your path definitions and replace them:**

```python
# REPLACE your old path definitions with these

# --- Path Definitions ---
BASE_DIR = Path(__file__).resolve().parent
GIT_REPO_PATH = BASE_DIR / 'git_repo' # This will be the root of our Git repository

# All data files now live inside the Git repo
REPO_PATH = GIT_REPO_PATH / 'repo' # For the .mcam files
LOCKS_FILE = GIT_REPO_PATH / 'locks.json'
USERS_FILE = GIT_REPO_PATH / 'users.json'
AUDIT_LOG_FILE = GIT_REPO_PATH / 'audit_log.json'
```

### **Step 2: Create the `initialize_git_repo` Function**

This function will check if a Git repo exists at our defined path. If not, it will create it, add our initial data files, and make the first commit.

**Add this code to `main.py`:**

```python
# ADD these imports to the top of main.py
from git import Repo, Actor
from git.exc import GitCommandError

# ADD this new function to main.py
def initialize_git_repo():
    """
    Checks for a Git repo at GIT_REPO_PATH. If it doesn't exist,
    it initializes a new one with our data files and an initial commit.
    Returns the Repo object.
    """
    # Check if the directory and the .git folder within it already exist.
    if GIT_REPO_PATH.exists() and (GIT_REPO_PATH / '.git').exists():
        logger.info("Git repository already exists. Loading it.")
        # If it exists, load it by creating an instance of the Repo class.
        return Repo(GIT_REPO_PATH)

    logger.info(f"Creating new Git repository at {GIT_REPO_PATH}")
    # Create the directory if it doesn't exist.
    GIT_REPO_PATH.mkdir(parents=True, exist_ok=True)
    # Repo.init() is a class method that runs `git init` and returns a new Repo instance.
    repo = Repo.init(GIT_REPO_PATH)

    # Create the initial files and directories inside our new repo.
    (GIT_REPO_PATH / 'repo').mkdir(exist_ok=True)
    LOCKS_FILE.write_text('{}')
    USERS_FILE.write_text('{}')
    AUDIT_LOG_FILE.write_text('[]')
    (GIT_REPO_PATH / '.gitignore').write_text('*.pyc\n__pycache__/\n')

    # Use the repo.index object (the Staging Area) to add the new files.
    repo.index.add([
        str(LOCKS_FILE.relative_to(GIT_REPO_PATH)),
        str(USERS_FILE.relative_to(GIT_REPO_PATH)),
        str(AUDIT_LOG_FILE.relative_to(GIT_REPO_PATH)),
        '.gitignore'
    ])

    # Create an Actor for the commit.
    author = Actor("PDM System", "system@pdm.local")

    # Use the index to create the commit.
    repo.index.commit("Initial repository setup", author=author, committer=author)

    logger.info("Git repository initialized successfully.")
    return repo

# --- Application Startup ---
# We create a global variable to hold our repo object.
git_repo: Optional[Repo] = None

@app.on_event("startup")
def startup_event():
    """
    This function runs once when the FastAPI application starts up.
    It's the perfect place to initialize our repository.
    """
    global git_repo
    # When the app starts, we initialize our repo and store the object in the global variable.
    git_repo = initialize_git_repo()
    create_default_users() # This will now write users.json inside the git repo
```

**Checkpoint:** Delete your old `repo`, `locks.json`, and `users.json` files. Restart your server. A new `git_repo` directory should appear, fully initialized with an initial commit\! You can `cd backend/git_repo` and run `git log` to see it.

---

## 7.4: Refactoring Save Operations into Git Commits

Now for the main event. We will replace our simple `save_locks` and `save_users` functions with new versions that create a Git commit for every change.

### **Step 1: The Generic Commit Function**

To avoid repeating ourselves (DRY principle), we'll create a single helper function that can save _any_ file and commit the change.

**Add this function to `main.py`:**

```python
# ADD this generic save function to main.py
def save_data_with_commit(filepath: Path, data, user: str, message: str, is_json: bool = True):
    """
    A generic function to save data to a file and create a Git commit.
    This is our transactional save operation.
    """
    try:
        # 1. Write the file to the working directory
        with open(filepath, 'w') as f:
            if is_json:
                json.dump(data, f, indent=2)
            else:
                f.write(data) # For non-JSON data

        # 2. Add the changed file to the staging area
        # We must provide the path relative to the repo's root.
        relative_path = str(filepath.relative_to(GIT_REPO_PATH))
        git_repo.index.add([relative_path])

        # 3. Commit the staged changes
        author = Actor(user, f"{user}@pdm.local")
        commit = git_repo.index.commit(message, author=author, committer=author)

        logger.info(f"Committed change to {filepath.name} in commit {commit.hexsha[:7]}")

    except GitCommandError as e:
        logger.error(f"Git error during commit for {filepath.name}: {e}")
        # If the commit fails, we should probably revert the file change.
        # `git reset --hard` is one way to do this.
        git_repo.index.reset(hard=True)
        raise HTTPException(status_code=500, detail="Failed to commit changes to version control.")
```

### **Step 2: Refactor the Old Save Functions**

Now, replace your old `save_locks` and `save_users` functions to simply call our new generic helper.

**Replace the old `save_locks` and `save_users` in `main.py`:**

```python
def save_locks(locks: dict, user: str, message: str):
    """Saves the locks dictionary and creates a commit."""
    save_data_with_commit(LOCKS_FILE, locks, user, message)

def save_users(users: dict, commit_user: str, commit_message: str):
    """Saves the user dictionary and creates a commit."""
    save_data_with_commit(USERS_FILE, users, commit_user, commit_message)

# Also update the audit log to commit its changes
def log_audit_event(user: str, action: str, target: str, details: dict = None):
    # ... (existing event creation logic) ...
    # Instead of opening and writing the file directly, load, append, and save with commit.
    log_data = []
    if AUDIT_LOG_FILE.exists():
        with open(AUDIT_LOG_FILE, 'r') as f:
            log_data = json.load(f)
    log_data.append(event)
    save_data_with_commit(AUDIT_LOG_FILE, log_data, user, f"AUDIT: {action} on {target}")
```

### **Step 3: Update the Endpoints**

Finally, update the endpoints like `checkout_file` and `checkin_file` to pass the user and a descriptive commit message to the `save_locks` function.

**Update the `checkout_file` function in `main.py`:**

```python
# In checkout_file, find the call to save_locks and update it:
    # ...
    # locks[request.filename] = { ... }
    commit_msg = f"Checkout: {request.filename} by {current_user.username}"
    save_locks(locks, current_user.username, commit_msg) # Pass user and message
    # ...
```

Do the same for `checkin_file`, providing a relevant commit message.

**Checkpoint:** Restart the server. Check out a file using the UI. Now, in your terminal, navigate to `backend/git_repo` and run `git log --oneline`. You will see a new commit for your action, authored by the user you entered\!

---

## 7.5: Viewing Git History from the API

Let's expose this rich history to our users through a new API endpoint.

**Add this endpoint to `main.py`:**

```python
@app.get("/api/files/{filename}/history")
def get_file_history(
    filename: str,
    limit: int = 50,
    current_user: User = Depends(get_current_user)
):
    """
    Returns the commit history for changes related to a specific file's lock status.
    """
    try:
        # repo.iter_commits() is a powerful method for walking the commit history.
        # `paths` filters the history to only include commits that touched a specific file.
        commits = list(git_repo.iter_commits(paths=str(LOCKS_FILE.relative_to(GIT_REPO_PATH)), max_count=limit))

        history = []
        for commit in commits:
            # We check the commit message to see if this commit is relevant to the requested file.
            # This is a simple filter; a more robust way might be to inspect the diff.
            if filename in commit.message:
                history.append({
                    "hash": commit.hexsha,
                    "author": commit.author.name,
                    "date": commit.committed_datetime.isoformat(),
                    "message": commit.message.strip()
                })

        return {"filename": filename, "history": history}

    except GitCommandError as e:
        logger.error(f"Git error getting history: {e}")
        raise HTTPException(status_code=500, detail="Failed to retrieve file history.")
```

**Update the frontend `showHistory` function in `app.js`** to call this new endpoint and display the results in the history modal. You can now build a UI that shows who checked out a file and when, with the exact commit hash for reference.

---

## Stage 7 Complete - A Version-Controlled Backend\!

Your application no longer deals with simple files; it interacts with a robust, version-controlled repository. Every important state change is now a permanent, auditable commit in your Git history.

### What's Next?

Your Git repository currently only exists on your local machine. In the next part of our tutorial, we would connect this to a remote on **GitLab**, implementing `push` and `pull` operations to create a truly collaborative and backed-up system. From there, **Stage 8** will focus on building more advanced Git features like versioned downloads and diff viewing.

That's an excellent question that gets to the heart of software engineering and application design. You're right to ask it now.

For our tutorial, **yes, we are keeping everything in the `backend` folder** for simplicity. However, for a real-world desktop application, this is **not** the best practice, and you've identified a key architectural decision.

Let's break down the "why" and then explore the professional solution.

---

## The Tutorial Approach vs. The Production Approach

### Our Current Tutorial Approach

We are storing the `git_repo` (which contains `locks.json`, `users.json`, etc.) right next to our Python code (`main.py`).

- **Why we're doing this:** It's simple and self-contained. Everything is in one place, which is easy to manage while you're learning the core concepts of FastAPI, Git, and security. It works perfectly in a development environment.

- **Why it's bad for a real desktop app:**

  1.  **Permissions Issues:** On Windows, applications are typically installed in `C:\Program Files`. On macOS, they're in `/Applications`. These are system-protected directories. A regular user does not have permission to write files there. Your PDM app would crash the first time it tried to create a commit or save `locks.json` because it wouldn't be allowed to modify its own installation folder.
  2.  **Data Mixed with Code:** It's a core principle of software design to separate the application's **code** (which is static) from the user's **data** (which is dynamic). If you were to update your PDM app to a new version, you wouldn't want the update process to accidentally delete the user's entire Git history\!
  3.  **Multi-User Systems:** If two different users log into the same computer, they would end up sharing the same `git_repo`, which is not the "individual machine" model you want.

---

## The Professional Solution: Application Data Directories

Operating systems have standard, designated locations where applications are supposed to store user-specific data, configuration, and cache files. A professional desktop application places its data in these folders.

Here's where the data for an app named "PDMApp" would go:

- **Windows:** In the user's `AppData` folder. The full path would typically be:
  `C:\Users\<YourUsername>\AppData\Roaming\PDMApp`
  (You can type `%APPDATA%` in the File Explorer address bar to get there).

- **macOS:** In the user's `Library/Application Support` folder:
  `~/Library/Application Support/PDMApp`

- **Linux:** Following the XDG Base Directory Specification, it would be in:
  `~/.local/share/PDMApp`

### How to Do This in Python: The `appdirs` Library

You don't need to manually figure out the OS and build these paths. There's a fantastic little library called `appdirs` that does it for you.

#### 🏋️ Practice Exercise: The App Data Path Finder

Let's create a small sandbox script to see this in action.

1.  **Install the library:**
    ```bash
    pip install appdirs
    ```
2.  **Create a new file, `app_data_paths.py`:**

    ```python
    # backend/app_data_paths.py

    from appdirs import user_data_dir, user_config_dir, user_cache_dir

    # Define your application's name and author (for namespacing)
    app_name = "PDMApp"
    app_author = "PDM Inc"

    # Get the standard data directory for the current OS
    data_dir = user_data_dir(app_name, app_author)

    # Get the standard config directory
    config_dir = user_config_dir(app_name, app_author)

    # Get the standard cache directory
    cache_dir = user_cache_dir(app_name, app_author)

    print(f"--- Standard Application Directories for '{app_name}' ---")
    print(f"OS: {os.name}")
    print(f"User Data should go here:   {data_dir}")
    print(f"User Config should go here: {config_dir}")
    print(f"Cache files should go here: {cache_dir}")

    # How you would use it in your app:
    # GIT_REPO_PATH = Path(data_dir)
    # if not GIT_REPO_PATH.exists():
    #     GIT_REPO_PATH.mkdir(parents=True)
    ```

3.  **Run the script:**
    ```bash
    python app_data_paths.py
    ```
    The script will print the correct, OS-specific path where you _should_ store your `git_repo` for a real desktop application. This approach cleanly separates your code from your data and works correctly with system permissions.

### Our Path Forward

For the remainder of our tutorial, we will **continue to keep the `git_repo` inside our `backend` folder**. This keeps things simple and focused on the core concepts we're learning.

However, when you are ready to package this application for real users, you would modify the `GIT_REPO_PATH` definition in your code to use a library like `appdirs` to find the appropriate user data directory. You've correctly identified the crucial bridge between our educational project and a production-grade desktop app.

This was a fantastic question. With that clarified, we are perfectly set up to begin **Stage 7**. Ready?

Excellent. With a solid understanding of Git from the command line, we're now ready to integrate that power directly into our Python application.

This stage is a fantastic opportunity to learn how to work with a professional-grade library like `GitPython`. You're right, documentation can often feel opaque. The key is to identify the main classes and understand them as Python objects with methods and attributes. We won't just use the library; we'll dissect it, explaining how each Python call maps to the Git commands you just learned.

Let's begin **Stage 7**.

---

# Stage 7: Git Integration & The `GitPython` Library (Expanded & Unified)

## Introduction: The Goal of This Stage

Our application's state (locks, users, audit logs) is stored in JSON files, but the history is lost with every change. In this stage, we will transform our application into a true version control system by using a Git repository as our database. Every significant action will become an **atomic Git commit**, creating a complete, auditable, and indestructible history.

---

### **🧠 Foundational Concepts: A Deeper Look**

- **Time Investment:** 6-8 hours.
- **How to Read Library Docs**: When approaching a new library like `GitPython`, the first step is to identify its core objects. Don't try to read the docs from top to bottom. Instead, look for the main entry point. For us, it's the `git.Repo` class. Once you have an instance of that object (`repo = Repo(...)`), you can explore what it can do (`repo.index`, `repo.iter_commits()`, etc.). We will model this process.
- **Design Pattern: Transactional State Changes**. By wrapping our file modifications in a `git commit`, we are creating a **transaction**. The `git add` and `git commit` sequence is **atomic**: either all the changes are saved successfully in a new commit, or nothing is. This prevents our application from ever being left in a partially-saved, corrupted state.

---

## 7.1: Installing `GitPython`

This library is the bridge between our Python code and the Git executable on your system.

**In your activated virtual environment, run:**

```bash
pip install GitPython
pip freeze > requirements.txt
```

---

## 7.2: Understanding the `GitPython` Object Model

Let's map the Git concepts you learned in the prelude to their corresponding Python classes in the library.

- **`git.Repo`**: This is the main class. An instance of this class represents your entire repository on disk.

  - `Repo.init(path)`: A **class method** that runs `git init` and returns a new `Repo` object.
  - `Repo(path)`: The **constructor** that loads an existing repository from a path and returns a `Repo` object.

- **`repo.index`**: An attribute of a `Repo` object. It represents the **Staging Area (Index)**.

  - `repo.index.add(['file1.txt'])`: Equivalent to `git add file1.txt`.
  - `repo.index.commit("My message")`: Equivalent to `git commit -m "My message"`.

- **`git.Actor`**: A simple class for representing a person (an author or committer), holding their `name` and `email`.

- **`git.Commit`**: The object representing a single commit. You get these when you iterate through the history. It has attributes like `.hexsha`, `.message`, `.author`, and `.committed_datetime`.

- **`repo.remote()`**: A method that returns a `Remote` object (e.g., `origin`), which you can then use to `.push()` or `.pull()`.

- **Further Reading**:

  - **GitPython Tutorial**: [https://gitpython.readthedocs.io/en/stable/tutorial.html](https://gitpython.readthedocs.io/en/stable/tutorial.html) (A great starting point).
  - **Repo Object API Reference**: [https://gitpython.readthedocs.io/en/stable/reference.html\#git.repo.base.Repo](https://www.google.com/search?q=https://gitpython.readthedocs.io/en/stable/reference.html%23git.repo.base.Repo) (Useful for seeing all available methods).

---

## 7.3: Initializing the Repository on Application Startup

Our first task is to make sure our application's data directory is a Git repository. We'll write a function that runs once when the server starts.

### **Step 1: Update Path Constants in `main.py`**

We'll create a new top-level `git_repo` directory to hold all our version-controlled data.

**In `main.py`, find your path definitions and replace them:**

```python
# REPLACE your old path definitions at the top of main.py

# --- Path Definitions ---
BASE_DIR = Path(__file__).resolve().parent
GIT_REPO_PATH = BASE_DIR / 'git_repo' # This is the root of our new Git repo

# All data files now live inside this version-controlled directory
REPO_PATH = GIT_REPO_PATH / 'repo' # For the .mcam files
LOCKS_FILE = GIT_REPO_PATH / 'locks.json'
USERS_FILE = GIT_REPO_PATH / 'users.json'
AUDIT_LOG_FILE = GIT_REPO_PATH / 'audit_log.json'
```

### **Step 2: Create the `initialize_git_repo` Function**

This function will set up the Git repository if it doesn't already exist.

**Add this code to `main.py`:**

```python
# ADD these imports to the top of main.py
from git import Repo, Actor
from git.exc import GitCommandError

# ADD this new function to main.py
def initialize_git_repo():
    """
    Initializes the Git repository if it doesn't exist.
    Returns the git.Repo object for the application to use.
    """
    if GIT_REPO_PATH.exists() and (GIT_REPO_PATH / '.git').exists():
        logger.info("Git repository already exists. Loading it.")
        # If the repo is already there, we create a Repo instance by passing the path.
        return Repo(GIT_REPO_PATH)

    logger.info(f"Creating new Git repository at {GIT_REPO_PATH}")
    GIT_REPO_PATH.mkdir(parents=True, exist_ok=True)
    # Repo.init() is a class method that runs `git init` on the given path.
    repo = Repo.init(GIT_REPO_PATH)

    # Create the initial files and directories we need.
    (GIT_REPO_PATH / 'repo').mkdir(exist_ok=True)
    LOCKS_FILE.write_text('{}')
    USERS_FILE.write_text('{}') # Will be populated by create_default_users
    AUDIT_LOG_FILE.write_text('[]')
    (GIT_REPO_PATH / '.gitignore').write_text('*.pyc\n__pycache__/\n')

    with repo.config_writer() as cw:
        cw.set_value("user", "name", "PDM System")
        cw.set_value("user", "email", "system@pdm.local")

    # repo.index is the Staging Area. .add() is equivalent to `git add`.
    repo.index.add([
        str(LOCKS_FILE.relative_to(GIT_REPO_PATH)),
        str(USERS_FILE.relative_to(GIT_REPO_PATH)),
        str(AUDIT_LOG_FILE.relative_to(GIT_REPO_PATH)),
        '.gitignore'
    ])

    # repo.index.commit() is equivalent to `git commit`.
    repo.index.commit("Initial repository setup")

    logger.info("Git repository initialized successfully.")
    return repo

# --- Application Startup ---
# Create a global variable to hold our single Repo object instance.
git_repo: Optional[Repo] = None

# Update your startup_event function
@app.on_event("startup")
def startup_event():
    global git_repo
    git_repo = initialize_git_repo()
    create_default_users()
```

**Checkpoint:** Delete any old `repo`, `locks.json`, etc. folders/files from your `backend` directory. Restart your server. A new `git_repo` directory should appear, fully initialized with an initial commit\! You can navigate into `backend/git_repo` in your terminal and run `git log` to see it.

---

## 7.4: Refactoring Save Operations into Git Commits

Now for the core logic. Every time we save state, we will create a Git commit.

### **Step 1: The Generic `save_data_with_commit` Function**

To avoid repeating code, we'll create one generic helper function to handle saving and committing.

**Add this function to `main.py`:**

```python
# ADD this generic save function to main.py
def save_data_with_commit(filepath: Path, data, user: str, message: str, is_json: bool = True):
    """
    A generic function to save data to a file and create an atomic Git commit.
    This is our new transactional save operation.
    """
    # In a multi-user environment (Model A or B), we should always pull first
    # to get the latest changes and reduce the chance of merge conflicts.
    # We will implement push_to_gitlab and pull_from_gitlab next.
    # pull_from_gitlab()

    try:
        # Step 1: Write the file to the working directory
        with open(filepath, 'w') as f:
            if is_json:
                json.dump(data, f, indent=2)
            else:
                f.write(data)

        # Step 2: Add the changed file to the staging area (`git add`)
        relative_path = str(filepath.relative_to(GIT_REPO_PATH))
        git_repo.index.add([relative_path])

        # Step 3: Commit the staged changes (`git commit`)
        author = Actor(user, f"{user}@pdm.local")
        git_repo.index.commit(message, author=author)

        logger.info(f"Committed change to {filepath.name}: {message}")

        # Step 4: Push the change to the remote repo (optional)
        # push_to_gitlab()

    except GitCommandError as e:
        logger.error(f"Git error during commit for {filepath.name}: {e}")
        # If the commit fails, we should revert the file change in the working directory
        # to keep the state consistent with the last successful commit.
        git_repo.index.reset(hard=True)
        raise HTTPException(status_code=500, detail="Failed to commit changes to version control.")
```

### **Step 2: Refactor All Save Functions**

Now, replace your old file-writing functions to use this new, powerful helper.

**Replace the old `save_locks`, `save_users`, and `log_audit_event` logic in `main.py`:**

```python
def save_locks(locks: dict, user: str, message: str):
    """Saves the locks dictionary by creating a new commit."""
    save_data_with_commit(LOCKS_FILE, locks, user, message)

def save_users(users: dict, commit_user: str, commit_message: str):
    """Saves the user dictionary by creating a new commit."""
    save_data_with_commit(USERS_FILE, users, commit_user, commit_message)

def log_audit_event(user: str, action: str, target: str, details: dict = None):
    # This function now needs to read the log, append the new event, and save it back.
    event = {
        "id": str(uuid.uuid4()),
        "timestamp": datetime.now(timezone.utc).isoformat(),
        "user": user, "action": action.upper(), "target": target, "details": details or {}
    }

    log_data = []
    if AUDIT_LOG_FILE.exists() and AUDIT_LOG_FILE.stat().st_size > 0:
        with open(AUDIT_LOG_FILE, 'r') as f:
            log_data = json.load(f)

    log_data.append(event)
    commit_message = f"AUDIT: {action} on {target} by {user}"
    save_data_with_commit(AUDIT_LOG_FILE, log_data, user, commit_message)
```

### **Step 3: Update the Endpoints to Provide Commit Details**

Finally, update your `checkout_file` and `checkin_file` endpoints to pass a user and a descriptive commit message.

**Update the `checkout_file` and `checkin_file` functions in `main.py`:**

```python
# In checkout_file, find the call to save_locks and update it:
    # ...
    commit_msg = f"Checkout: {request.filename} by {current_user.username}"
    save_locks(locks, current_user.username, commit_msg) # Pass user and message
    # ...

# In checkin_file, find the call to save_locks and update it:
    # ...
    commit_msg = f"Checkin: {request.filename} by {current_user.username}"
    save_locks(locks, current_user.username, commit_msg) # Pass user and message
    # ...
```

**Checkpoint:** Restart your server. Check out a file using the UI. In your terminal, navigate to `backend/git_repo` and run `git log`. You will see a new commit for your action\!

---

## 7.5: Viewing Git History from the API

Let's expose this powerful history to our users through a new API endpoint.

**Add this endpoint to `main.py`:**

```python
@app.get("/api/files/{filename}/history")
def get_file_history(
    filename: str, limit: int = 50, current_user: User = Depends(get_current_user)
):
    """Returns the commit history for changes related to a file's lock status."""
    try:
        # repo.iter_commits() is a generator that walks the commit history.
        # It's equivalent to `git log`. `paths` filters for commits touching a file.
        commits = list(git_repo.iter_commits(paths=str(LOCKS_FILE.relative_to(GIT_REPO_PATH)), max_count=limit))

        history = []
        for commit in commits:
            # The Commit object has useful attributes like .hexsha, .author, etc.
            if filename in commit.message: # Simple filter based on commit message
                history.append({
                    "hash": commit.hexsha,
                    "author": commit.author.name,
                    "date": commit.committed_datetime.isoformat(),
                    "message": commit.message.strip()
                })

        return {"filename": filename, "history": history}
    except GitCommandError as e:
        raise HTTPException(status_code=500, detail="Failed to retrieve file history.")
```

You can now test this endpoint with `curl` or by wiring it up to a history modal in the frontend to see the full version history of a file's lock status.

---

## Stage 7 Complete - A Version-Controlled Backend\!

Your application's state is now managed by a robust, transactional, and fully auditable Git repository. You have mastered the `GitPython` library's core objects and can confidently map its methods back to the Git commands you know.

### What's Next?

Your Git repository currently only exists locally. For either of your desired deployment models (standalone or centralized), we need to connect to a remote server like GitLab. This is a crucial step for backup and collaboration. After that, in **Stage 8**, we'll build the frontend features to take advantage of this new versioned backend, like versioned downloads and diff viewing.

Excellent. Now that our backend is powered by a full Git repository, let's build the frontend features to unlock that power for the user. This stage is all about creating a rich, interactive experience for version control.

We'll continue our step-by-step approach, building each feature piece by piece. We'll dive deep into how browsers handle file uploads and downloads, and how `GitPython` allows us to extract detailed historical information like diffs and blame.

Let's begin **Stage 8**.

---

# Stage 8: Advanced Git Features - Upload, Download, Diff & Blame (Expanded & Unified)

## Introduction: The Goal of This Stage

Our application has a robust version-controlled backend, but the user can't access most of its power. They can't add new files, retrieve old versions, or see what has changed. This stage is about building the user interface for these advanced Git features.

By the end of this stage, you will:

- Implement a drag-and-drop file upload system that creates new Git commits.
- Build a download feature that can retrieve both the latest and any historical version of a file.
- Create a visual "diff" viewer to show exactly what changed in a commit.
- Implement a "blame" view to see line-by-line author attribution.

---

### **🧠 Foundational Concepts: A Deeper Look**

- **Time Investment:** 7-9 hours. This is a feature-rich stage that touches many different browser APIs and backend logic.
- **CS Topic: Multipart/form-data**. When you upload a file, the browser doesn't send it as a simple text request. It uses a special encoding type, `multipart/form-data`, defined in **RFC 1867** (from 1995\!). It breaks the request into parts, each with its own headers, allowing binary file data to be sent along with regular form text. FastAPI's `UploadFile` handles parsing this for us.
- **CS Topic: Streaming**. When dealing with potentially large files, loading the entire file into memory is inefficient and risky (it can crash your server). **Streaming** is the process of reading and sending the file in small, manageable chunks. We'll use FastAPI's `StreamingResponse` to do this efficiently for downloads.

---

## 8.1: File Upload

Our first feature is to allow users to add new `.mcam` files to the repository.

### **Step 1: The Backend Upload Endpoint**

We need an endpoint that can receive file data.

**Add this new endpoint to `backend/main.py`:**

```python
# Add these imports to the top of main.py
from fastapi import File, UploadFile
import shutil

# Add this new endpoint to main.py
@app.post("/api/files/upload")
async def upload_file(
    # `File(...)` tells FastAPI to expect a file in the multipart form data.
    # `UploadFile` is a special class that provides async methods for handling the file.
    file: UploadFile = File(...),
    current_user: User = Depends(get_current_user)
):
    """
    Handles uploading a new .mcam file, validating it, and committing it to Git.
    """
    logger.info(f"Upload request from '{current_user.username}' for file '{file.filename}'")

    # --- Security & Validation ---
    if not file.filename:
        raise HTTPException(status_code=400, detail="No filename provided.")

    # 1. Sanitize the filename to prevent directory traversal attacks (e.g., ../../etc/passwd)
    # os.path.basename strips any directory information, leaving only the filename.
    safe_filename = Path(os.path.basename(file.filename))
    file_path = REPO_PATH / safe_filename

    # 2. Check for the correct file extension.
    if not str(safe_filename).lower().endswith('.mcam'):
        raise HTTPException(status_code=400, detail="Invalid file type. Only .mcam files are allowed.")

    # 3. Prevent overwriting existing files. A different endpoint (PUT or PATCH) would handle updates.
    if file_path.exists():
        raise HTTPException(status_code=409, detail=f"File '{safe_filename}' already exists.")

    try:
        # 4. Write the uploaded file content to disk in binary mode ('wb').
        # `shutil.copyfileobj` is efficient for streaming the upload to a file.
        with open(file_path, "wb") as buffer:
            shutil.copyfileobj(file.file, buffer)

        # --- Git Operation ---
        commit_msg = f"Add file: {safe_filename}"
        save_data_with_commit(
            filepath=file_path,
            data=None, # We're not writing JSON, the file is already on disk
            user=current_user.username,
            message=commit_msg,
            is_json=False # This signals our helper to not use json.dump
        )

        log_audit_event(...) # Add your audit log call here

        return {"success": True, "message": f"File '{safe_filename}' uploaded successfully."}

    except Exception as e:
        logger.error(f"Upload failed for file '{file.filename}': {e}")
        raise HTTPException(status_code=500, detail="An unexpected error occurred during file upload.")
```

### **Step 2: The Frontend Upload UI**

Let's build a nice drag-and-drop area for uploads.

**Add this new `<section>` to `backend/static/index.html` inside `<main>`:**

```html
<section>
  <h2>Upload New File</h2>
  <div class="upload-area" id="upload-area">
    <input type="file" id="file-input" accept=".mcam" style="display: none;" />
    <div id="upload-prompt">
      <p>📁 Drag & drop a .mcam file here, or click to select</p>
      <p class="upload-hint">Maximum file size: 10MB</p>
    </div>
    <div id="file-preview" class="hidden"></div>
  </div>
  <button type="button" class="btn btn-primary" id="upload-btn" disabled>
    Upload File
  </button>
</section>
```

**Add these styles to `backend/static/css/components.css`:**

```css
.upload-area {
  border: 2px dashed var(--border-focus);
  border-radius: var(--radius-md);
  padding: var(--spacing-8);
  text-align: center;
  cursor: pointer;
  transition: all var(--transition-fast);
  background: var(--bg-secondary);
}
.upload-area:hover {
  background: var(--bg-tertiary);
}
.upload-area.drag-over {
  border-style: solid;
  background: var(--status-info-bg);
}
.upload-hint {
  font-size: var(--font-size-sm);
  color: var(--text-secondary);
}
.file-preview {
  font-weight: var(--font-weight-medium);
}
#upload-btn:disabled {
  opacity: 0.5;
  cursor: not-allowed;
  transform: none;
  box-shadow: none;
}
```

### **Step 3: The Frontend Upload Logic**

This JavaScript will handle the UI states, drag-and-drop events, and the `fetch` request.

**Add this code to your `DOMContentLoaded` listener in `app.js`:**

```javascript
// In app.js, inside the DOMContentLoaded listener
setupFileUpload();
```

**Now, add these new functions to `app.js`:**

```javascript
function setupFileUpload() {
  const uploadArea = document.getElementById("upload-area");
  const fileInput = document.getElementById("file-input");
  const uploadBtn = document.getElementById("upload-btn");
  let fileToUpload = null;

  // --- UI Helper ---
  const showPreview = (file) => {
    fileToUpload = file;
    document.getElementById("upload-prompt").classList.add("hidden");
    const preview = document.getElementById("file-preview");
    preview.textContent = `Ready to upload: ${file.name}`;
    preview.classList.remove("hidden");
    uploadBtn.disabled = false;
  };

  // --- Event Listeners ---
  uploadArea.addEventListener("click", () => fileInput.click());
  fileInput.addEventListener("change", () => showPreview(fileInput.files[0]));

  // Drag and Drop Events
  uploadArea.addEventListener("dragover", (e) => {
    e.preventDefault(); // This is crucial to allow the 'drop' event to fire
    uploadArea.classList.add("drag-over");
  });
  uploadArea.addEventListener("dragleave", () =>
    uploadArea.classList.remove("drag-over")
  );
  uploadArea.addEventListener("drop", (e) => {
    e.preventDefault();
    uploadArea.classList.remove("drag-over");
    const file = e.dataTransfer.files[0];
    if (file && file.name.toLowerCase().endsWith(".mcam")) {
      showPreview(file);
    } else {
      showNotification("Only .mcam files are allowed.", "error");
    }
  });

  // Upload Button Click Handler
  uploadBtn.addEventListener("click", async () => {
    if (!fileToUpload) return;

    // Create a FormData object to send the file
    const formData = new FormData();
    formData.append("file", fileToUpload);

    try {
      const token = localStorage.getItem("access_token");
      const response = await fetch("/api/files/upload", {
        method: "POST",
        headers: { Authorization: `Bearer ${token}` },
        body: formData, // When using FormData, the browser sets the Content-Type header automatically
      });

      const data = await response.json();
      if (!response.ok) throw new Error(data.detail);

      showNotification(data.message, "success");
      loadFiles(); // Refresh file list
    } catch (error) {
      showNotification(`Upload failed: ${error.message}`, "error");
    } finally {
      // Reset the UI
    }
  });
}
```

**Checkpoint:** Refresh your application. You should see the new upload section. Try dragging a file onto it or clicking it. After uploading, the file list should refresh, and you can confirm a new commit was created in your `git_repo`.

---

## 8.2: Versioned File Download

Now, let's allow users to download both the latest version of a file and any previous version from its Git history.

### **Step 1: The Backend Download Endpoint**

**Add this new endpoint to `main.py`:**

```python
# ADD this import at the top of main.py
from fastapi.responses import StreamingResponse
import io

# ADD this new endpoint to main.py
@app.get("/api/files/{filename}/download")
async def download_file(
    filename: str,
    commit_sha: Optional[str] = None, # Optional query parameter for the version
    current_user: User = Depends(get_current_user)
):
    logger.info(f"Download request for '{filename}' by '{current_user.username}' (commit: {commit_sha or 'HEAD'})")
    safe_filename = os.path.basename(filename)

    try:
        file_content_bytes: bytes
        if commit_sha:
            # --- Get a HISTORICAL version from the Git object database ---
            commit = git_repo.commit(commit_sha)
            # We navigate the commit's file tree to find the file's "blob"
            blob = commit.tree / 'repo' / safe_filename
            # We read the raw byte content from the blob
            file_content_bytes = blob.data_stream.read()
        else:
            # --- Get the LATEST version from the working directory ---
            file_path = REPO_PATH / safe_filename
            if not file_path.exists():
                raise HTTPException(status_code=404, detail="File not found.")
            file_content_bytes = file_path.read_bytes()

        # `StreamingResponse` sends the file in chunks, which is memory-efficient for large files.
        return StreamingResponse(
            io.BytesIO(file_content_bytes),
            media_type="application/octet-stream", # A generic type for binary files
            # This header tells the browser to trigger a download dialog
            headers={'Content-Disposition': f'attachment; filename="{safe_filename}"'}
        )
    except KeyError:
        raise HTTPException(status_code=404, detail=f"File not found in commit {commit_sha[:7]}.")
    except Exception as e:
        logger.error(f"Download failed: {e}")
        raise HTTPException(status_code=500, detail="File download failed.")
```

### **Step 2: Frontend Download Buttons and History Modal**

We need a "History" modal where users can see past versions and choose one to download.

**Add the History Modal HTML to `index.html` (before `</body>`):**

```html
<div id="history-modal" class="modal-overlay hidden">
  <div class="modal-content modal-large">
    <div class="modal-header">
      <h3 id="history-title">File History</h3>
      <button class="modal-close">&times;</button>
    </div>
    <div id="history-content" class="modal-body"></div>
  </div>
</div>
```

_You'll also need a `.modal-large { max-width: 800px; }` style in `components.css`._

**Update `createFileElement` in `app.js` to add a "History" button:**

```javascript
// In the actionsDiv inside createFileElement
const historyBtn = document.createElement("button");
historyBtn.className = "btn btn-secondary";
historyBtn.textContent = "History";
historyBtn.onclick = () => showHistory(file.name);
actionsDiv.appendChild(historyBtn);
```

**Add the `showHistory` and `handleDownload` functions to `app.js`:**

```javascript
// Add these new functions to app.js
const historyModal = new ModalManager("history-modal");

async function showHistory(filename) {
  historyModal.open();
  const content = document.getElementById("history-content");
  content.innerHTML = "<p>Loading history...</p>";

  try {
    const token = localStorage.getItem("access_token");
    const response = await fetch(`/api/files/${filename}/history`, {
      headers: { Authorization: `Bearer ${token}` },
    });
    if (!response.ok) throw new Error("Failed to load history.");
    const data = await response.json();

    if (data.history.length === 0) {
      content.innerHTML = "<p>No history found for this file.</p>";
      return;
    }

    // Build a list of commits with download links for each version
    let html = "<ul>";
    data.history.forEach((commit) => {
      html += `
                <li>
                    <span>${commit.message} (by ${commit.author} on ${new Date(
        commit.date
      ).toLocaleDateString()})</span>
                    <button class="btn" onclick="handleDownload('${filename}', '${
        commit.hash
      }')">Download this version</button>
                </li>`;
    });
    html += "</ul>";
    content.innerHTML = html;
  } catch (error) {
    content.innerHTML = `<p style="color: red;">${error.message}</p>`;
  }
}

async function handleDownload(filename, commit_sha = null) {
  const url =
    `/api/files/${filename}/download` +
    (commit_sha ? `?commit_sha=${commit_sha}` : "");
  const token = localStorage.getItem("access_token");

  try {
    const response = await fetch(url, {
      headers: { Authorization: `Bearer ${token}` },
    });
    if (!response.ok) throw new Error("Download failed.");

    // This technique creates a temporary link to the file data and clicks it.
    const blob = await response.blob();
    const downloadUrl = window.URL.createObjectURL(blob);
    const a = document.createElement("a");
    a.href = downloadUrl;
    a.download = filename;
    document.body.appendChild(a);
    a.click();
    a.remove();
    window.URL.revokeObjectURL(downloadUrl); // Clean up the temporary URL
  } catch (error) {
    showNotification(`Error: ${error.message}`, "error");
  }
}
```

**Checkpoint:** You can now click "History" on a file, and the modal will show a list of relevant commits. Clicking "Download this version" will download the file as it existed at that point in time\!

---

## Stage 8 Complete - Advanced Git Features\!

You have now built an incredibly powerful set of features that expose the core value of version control directly to your users. They can add files, retrieve any historical version, and will soon be able to see exactly what changed.

### What's Next?

The `showDiff` and `showBlame` features are very similar in structure. As a challenge, try to implement them yourself using the patterns above\! You'll need:

1.  A new backend endpoint for each (`/diff` and `/blame`).
2.  New modals in `index.html`.
3.  New `ModalManager` instances and handler functions (`showDiff`, `showBlame`) in `app.js`.

In **Stage 9**, we will make the application collaborative in real-time using **WebSockets**.

That is an **incredibly sharp question**, and you're thinking exactly like a system architect. It's the perfect time to ask this, as it gets to the heart of what WebSockets are for.

**You are absolutely correct.** In a "standalone desktop" model where each user runs their own server, WebSockets **do not provide any real-time collaboration between users**.

Let's clarify the two models we discussed:

1.  **Model A (Standalone/Distributed):** Each user runs their own server. Communication with _other_ users happens **asynchronously** through a shared Git remote.

    - Alice checks out a file. A commit is made on _her_ machine.
    - Bob doesn't know this happened.
    - Alice runs `git push`.
    - Bob runs `git pull`. Now, Bob's local repository is updated, and his UI will reflect that the file is locked by Alice.
    - In this model, **Git is the collaboration mechanism**, not WebSockets. The updates are not real-time; they depend on the push/pull cycle.

2.  **Model B (Centralized Server):** All users connect their browsers to a single, shared server.

    - Alice checks out a file. Her browser sends a request to the central server.
    - The central server makes the Git commit.
    - The central server then immediately sends a WebSocket message to **all connected clients** (including Bob's browser) saying, "This file is now locked by Alice."
    - Bob's UI updates instantly, without him needing to do anything.
    - In this model, **WebSockets are the real-time collaboration mechanism**.

**So, why are we building it?** For flexibility. The architecture we're creating supports **both**. By adding WebSockets, we are enabling the real-time features for the centralized deployment model (Model B), which is the standard for most web applications. The features will simply be "inactive" in the standalone model.

You also asked if we should do a deep dive before Stage 9. Absolutely. Understanding the fundamentals will make the implementation much clearer.

Here is a prelude to Stage 9.

---

## Prelude to Stage 9: A Deep Dive into WebSockets

### The Problem: The Inefficiency of HTTP Polling

Imagine you're waiting for an important text message. You could unlock your phone, open the messaging app, check for new messages, and then lock your phone again, repeating this every 30 seconds. This is **polling**. It's annoying, wastes your time and your phone's battery, and you only get the message when you happen to check.

This is how web applications traditionally got "live" updates over HTTP. The browser would send a request to the server every few seconds (`GET /api/updates`), and most of the time the server would respond with "Nope, nothing new."

### The Solution: A Persistent, Two-Way Conversation

A **WebSocket** connection is like calling your friend and keeping the phone line open.

1.  You start with a normal HTTP request, but you ask for an "upgrade."
2.  The server agrees, and the connection switches protocols from HTTP to WebSocket.
3.  The connection now stays open, creating a persistent, **full-duplex** (two-way) communication channel.

Now, you don't have to ask for updates. Your friend (the server) can just tell you the news the instant it happens. The server can **push** data to the client at any time.

### How it Works: The WebSocket Handshake

This "protocol switch" is called the handshake. It's a clever trick using standard HTTP headers.

1.  **The Client's Request:** Your browser sends a standard `GET` request, but with special headers:

    ```http
    GET /ws HTTP/1.1
    Host: pdm-app.com
    Upgrade: websocket
    Connection: Upgrade
    Sec-WebSocket-Key: dGhlIHNhbXBsZSBub25jZQ==
    ```

    This is the client saying, "Hello, I'd like to speak HTTP, but I'd prefer to upgrade our conversation to WebSocket if you support it."

2.  **The Server's Response:** If the server supports WebSockets, it replies with a special `101 Switching Protocols` status code:

    ```http
    HTTP/1.1 101 Switching Protocols
    Upgrade: websocket
    Connection: Upgrade
    Sec-WebSocket-Accept: s3pPLMBiTxaQ9kYGzzhZRbK+xOo=
    ```

    This is the server saying, "Great\! Let's switch. The line is now open." The underlying TCP/IP connection is then kept alive for the two parties to send messages back and forth.

### Key Concepts for Building a Robust System

- **Heartbeats (Ping/Pong):** Network intermediaries (like proxies and firewalls) often close connections that appear to be idle. To prevent your WebSocket from being dropped, the client will periodically send a `ping` message to the server, and the server will reply with a `pong`. This small amount of traffic keeps the connection alive.

- **Reconnection Logic:** Network connections are unreliable. A user's WiFi might drop, or the server might restart. A professional frontend application must automatically try to reconnect. A common strategy is **exponential backoff**: try to reconnect after 1s, then 2s, then 4s, 8s, and so on, up to a maximum delay. This prevents the client from hammering a server that might be temporarily down.

- **Subprotocols:** Clients and servers can agree to speak a specific "dialect" over the WebSocket, like JSON. This is defined in the handshake. FastAPI handles this JSON serialization and deserialization for us automatically with `websocket.send_json()` and `websocket.receive_json()`.

- **Further Reading**:

  - **MDN Introduction to WebSockets**: A fantastic, high-level overview. [https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/WebSockets_API](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/WebSockets_API)
  - **RFC 6455 - The WebSocket Protocol**: The official technical specification. It's very dense, but it's the ultimate source of truth. [https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc6455](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc6455)

With this conceptual foundation, you are now ready to implement WebSockets in **Stage 9**.

You got it. We've laid all the necessary groundwork, and now it's time to make our application truly collaborative by adding a real-time communication layer.

We'll do this incrementally, starting with the "control tower" on the backend, then building the endpoint, and finally creating a resilient client on the frontend that listens for and reacts to server events.

Let's begin **Stage 9**.

---

# Stage 9: Real-Time Collaboration with WebSockets (Expanded & Unified)

## Introduction: The Goal of This Stage

Our application is functional, but it's "silent." When one user locks a file, other users have no idea until they manually refresh their page. This stage will add the "live" element by implementing **WebSockets**, enabling your server to push updates to all connected clients instantly.

This is a key feature for any collaborative application and will primarily enable the "Centralized Server" model we discussed.

---

### **🧠 Foundational Concepts: A Deeper Look**

- **Time Investment:** 6-8 hours.

- **Design Pattern: Publish/Subscribe (Pub/Sub)**. This is the core pattern we'll use. Our API endpoints will "publish" an event (e.g., `FILE_LOCKED`) to a central manager. The manager then broadcasts this event to all "subscribed" clients. The key here is decoupling: the endpoint doesn't know or care who is listening; it just announces that something happened.

- **CS Topic: Full-Duplex Communication**. Unlike HTTP's request-response cycle, a WebSocket provides a **full-duplex** channel. This means both the client and the server can send messages to each other at any time, independently, once the connection is established. It's a true two-way conversation.

- **Further Reading**:

## 9.1: The Backend - Building the Connection Manager

Our first step is to create a "control tower" on the server that will keep track of every user who is currently connected via a WebSocket.

### **Step 1: Create the `ConnectionManager` Class**

This class will be a singleton (a single, shared instance) in our application. It will be responsible for accepting new connections, handling disconnections, and broadcasting messages to all connected clients.

**Add this new class to `backend/main.py`:**

```python
# ADD these imports at the top of main.py
from fastapi import WebSocket, WebSocketDisconnect
from typing import List, Dict
import json

# ADD this new class to main.py, for example, after your Pydantic models
class ConnectionManager:
    """
    Manages active WebSocket connections. It acts as our central
    Pub/Sub hub for broadcasting real-time events to clients.
    """
    def __init__(self):
        # A dictionary to store active connections, mapping a username to their WebSocket object.
        self.active_connections: Dict[str, WebSocket] = {}

    async def connect(self, websocket: WebSocket, username: str):
        """Accepts a new WebSocket connection and adds it to our registry."""
        await websocket.accept() # Performs the WebSocket handshake.
        self.active_connections[username] = websocket
        logger.info(f"WebSocket connected: {username} (Total online: {len(self.active_connections)})")

    def disconnect(self, username: str):
        """Removes a WebSocket connection from the registry."""
        if username in self.active_connections:
            del self.active_connections[username]
            logger.info(f"WebSocket disconnected: {username} (Total online: {len(self.active_connections)})")

    async def broadcast(self, message: dict):
        """Sends a JSON message to all currently connected clients."""
        # We convert the Python dict to a JSON string before sending.
        message_json = json.dumps(message)

        # It's possible a client disconnected abruptly. If `send_text` fails,
        # we'll collect their username and clean them up after the loop.
        disconnected_users = []
        for username, connection in self.active_connections.items():
            try:
                await connection.send_text(message_json)
            except Exception:
                disconnected_users.append(username)

        for username in disconnected_users:
            self.disconnect(username)

    def get_online_users(self) -> List[str]:
        """Returns a list of all currently connected usernames."""
        return list(self.active_connections.keys())

# Create the single, global instance of the manager that our app will use.
manager = ConnectionManager()
```

---

## 9.2: Creating the WebSocket Endpoint

Now we need the actual endpoint that clients will connect to. This endpoint handles the initial authentication and then enters a loop to listen for messages for the duration of the connection.

### **Step 1: The `@app.websocket` Endpoint**

Authentication for WebSockets is a bit different. Since they don't use traditional HTTP headers after the initial connection, a secure and common pattern is to pass the JWT as a query parameter in the connection URL (e.g., `wss://pdm.com/ws?token=...`).

**Add this new endpoint to `backend/main.py`:**

```python
# ADD this new endpoint to main.py
@app.websocket("/ws")
async def websocket_endpoint(websocket: WebSocket, token: str):
    """
    The main WebSocket endpoint. It handles authentication for the connection,
    adds the user to the ConnectionManager, and then listens for messages
    until the client disconnects.
    """
    # 1. Authenticate the user from the token provided in the query parameter.
    try:
        payload = jwt.decode(token, SECRET_KEY, algorithms=[ALGORITHM])
        username: str = payload.get("sub")
        # Ensure the user from the token actually exists in our user database.
        if username is None or get_user(username) is None:
            await websocket.close(code=status.WS_1008_POLICY_VIOLATION)
            return
    except JWTError:
        # If the token is invalid or expired, close the connection.
        await websocket.close(code=status.WS_1008_POLICY_VIOLATION)
        return

    # 2. If authentication is successful, connect the user.
    await manager.connect(websocket, username)

    try:
        # 3. Enter an infinite loop to keep the connection alive.
        while True:
            # `receive_text()` waits until a message is received from the client.
            await websocket.receive_text()
            # For this tutorial, we're not expecting any specific messages from the client
            # after connection, but this is where you would handle them (e.g., for a chat app).
            # We'll add a heartbeat ping/pong handler here later.
    except WebSocketDisconnect:
        # 4. When the client disconnects, clean up their connection.
        manager.disconnect(username)
        # And broadcast to everyone else that this user has left.
        await manager.broadcast({
            "type": "user_disconnected",
            "username": username,
            "online_users": manager.get_online_users()
        })
```

---

## 9.3: Broadcasting Events from API Endpoints

Our WebSocket system is now ready to receive and send messages. Let's hook it into our existing logic. When a user successfully checks out a file, we want to broadcast a `file_locked` event to everyone.

### **Step 1: Make Endpoints `async`**

Since `manager.broadcast()` is an `async` function, any endpoint that calls it must also be declared with `async def`.

### **Step 2: Add Broadcast Calls**

Find your `checkout_file`, `checkin_file`, and `upload_file` functions in `main.py` and modify them.

**Update `checkout_file`:**

```python
# Change the function signature to `async def`
@app.post("/api/files/checkout")
async def checkout_file(request: FileCheckoutRequest, current_user: User = Depends(get_current_user)):
    # ... (all your existing validation and locking logic) ...

    save_locks(locks, current_user.username, commit_msg)

    # ADD THIS BROADCAST CALL before the return statement
    await manager.broadcast({
        "type": "file_locked",
        "filename": request.filename,
        "user": current_user.username,
        "message": request.message
    })

    log_audit_event(...)
    return {"success": True, "message": "File checked out successfully"}
```

**Update `checkin_file` and `upload_file`** in the same way, making them `async def` and adding a `await manager.broadcast({...})` call with an appropriate message payload (`"type": "file_unlocked"` or `"type": "file_uploaded"`) after the save operation.

**Checkpoint:** Your backend is now fully equipped for real-time communication\!

---

## 9.4: Building the Frontend WebSocket Client

Now, let's teach our frontend how to connect to the WebSocket and listen for these events.

### **Step 1: Add UI Elements for Presence**

First, add a place in `index.html` to show the connection status and the list of online users.

**Add to `index.html` (inside the `.header-actions` div):**

```html
<span id="connection-status" class="status-disconnected">🔴 Disconnected</span>
```

**Add to `index.html` (as a new `<section>` in `<main>`):**

```html
<section>
  <h2>Online Users</h2>
  <div id="online-users-list">
    <p>Connecting...</p>
  </div>
</section>
```

**Add these styles to `components.css`:**

```css
.status-connected,
.status-disconnected {
  margin-right: 1rem;
  font-weight: 500;
}
.status-connected {
  color: var(--status-success);
}
.status-disconnected {
  color: var(--status-danger);
}

#online-users-list ul {
  list-style: none;
  padding: 0;
}
#online-users-list li {
  display: flex;
  align-items: center;
  padding: 0.25rem 0;
}
#online-users-list .status-dot {
  height: 8px;
  width: 8px;
  background-color: var(--status-success);
  border-radius: 50%;
  display: inline-block;
  margin-right: 0.5rem;
}
```

### **Step 2: The WebSocket Connection Logic in `app.js`**

This is the most critical part of the frontend. This code will manage the connection, handle automatic reconnection, and implement a heartbeat to keep the connection alive.

**Add this entire block of code to `app.js`:**

```javascript
// Add at the top of app.js
let ws = null;
let reconnectAttempts = 0;

function connectWebSocket() {
  const token = localStorage.getItem("access_token");
  if (!token) return; // Don't connect if not logged in

  const protocol = window.location.protocol === "https:" ? "wss:" : "ws:";
  const wsUrl = `${protocol}//${window.location.host}/ws?token=${token}`;

  ws = new WebSocket(wsUrl);

  ws.onopen = () => {
    console.log("WebSocket connected!");
    updateConnectionStatus(true);
    reconnectAttempts = 0; // Reset counter on successful connection
    startHeartbeat();
  };

  ws.onmessage = (event) => {
    // This is where we receive events from the server
    handleWebSocketMessage(JSON.parse(event.data));
  };

  ws.onclose = () => {
    console.log("WebSocket disconnected.");
    updateConnectionStatus(false);
    stopHeartbeat();

    // --- Automatic Reconnection with Exponential Backoff ---
    const delay = Math.min(1000 * 2 ** reconnectAttempts, 30000); // 1s, 2s, 4s... up to 30s
    console.log(`Will attempt to reconnect in ${delay / 1000}s`);
    setTimeout(connectWebSocket, delay);
    reconnectAttempts++;
  };

  ws.onerror = (error) => {
    console.error("WebSocket error:", error);
    ws.close(); // This will trigger the onclose handler, which starts the reconnect logic
  };
}

function updateConnectionStatus(isConnected) {
  const statusEl = document.getElementById("connection-status");
  if (isConnected) {
    statusEl.textContent = "🟢 Connected";
    statusEl.className = "status-connected";
  } else {
    statusEl.textContent = "🔴 Disconnected";
    statusEl.className = "status-disconnected";
  }
}

// --- Heartbeat to keep connection alive ---
let heartbeatInterval = null;
function startHeartbeat() {
  heartbeatInterval = setInterval(() => {
    if (ws && ws.readyState === WebSocket.OPEN) {
      // The server is configured to ignore this, but it keeps the connection active
      ws.send(JSON.stringify({ type: "ping" }));
    }
  }, 30000); // Send a ping every 30 seconds
}
function stopHeartbeat() {
  clearInterval(heartbeatInterval);
  heartbeatInterval = null;
}

// --- Initialize the connection when the page loads ---
document.addEventListener("DOMContentLoaded", () => {
  // ... all your existing setup code ...
  connectWebSocket();
});
```

### **Step 3: Handling Incoming Messages**

Now, let's write the logic that reacts to the events pushed from the server.

**Add these new functions to `app.js`:**

```javascript
function handleWebSocketMessage(message) {
  console.log("WS Message Received:", message);
  switch (message.type) {
    case "file_locked":
    case "file_unlocked":
      // Find the file in our local state and update it
      const file = allFiles.find((f) => f.name === message.filename);
      if (file) {
        file.status =
          message.type === "file_locked" ? "checked_out" : "available";
        file.locked_by = message.type === "file_locked" ? message.user : null;
        displayFilteredAndSortedFiles(); // Re-render the UI
      }
      showNotification(
        `File '${message.filename}' was ${
          message.type === "file_locked" ? "locked" : "unlocked"
        } by ${message.user}.`,
        "info"
      );
      break;

    case "file_uploaded":
      loadFiles(); // Easiest way to handle is a full refresh of the file list
      showNotification(
        `New file '${message.filename}' was uploaded by ${message.user}.`,
        "info"
      );
      break;

    case "user_connected":
    case "user_disconnected":
    case "online_users": // Handle the initial list of users on connect
      updateOnlineUsersList(message.online_users);
      break;
  }
}

function updateOnlineUsersList(users) {
  const listEl = document.getElementById("online-users-list");
  const currentUser = parseJWT(localStorage.getItem("access_token")).sub;

  listEl.innerHTML =
    "<ul>" +
    users
      .map(
        (user) =>
          `<li><span class="status-dot"></span>${user}${
            user === currentUser ? " (You)" : ""

## Stage 9 Complete - A Live, Collaborative Application\!

You've done it\! Your application is no longer a static, single-user experience. It's a live, collaborative environment where changes are reflected instantly for all users.

### Verification Checklist

This is the most important step. You'll need two different browser windows (an incognito window works well) to test this.

- [ ] Open the app and log in as `john` in one window.
- [ ] Open an incognito window and log in as `admin`.
- [ ] The "Online Users" list in both windows should show both `john` and `admin`.
- [ ] In `john`'s window, check out a file. The UI in the **`admin` window** should update **instantly** to show the file is locked by `john`, without you refreshing the page.
- [ ] In the `admin` window, use the admin override to check the file back in. The UI in `john`'s window should update instantly.
- [ ] Close one of the browser windows. The "Online Users" list in the other window should update to show only one user.
- [ ] **The Resilience Test**: In one window, open your browser's DevTools, go to the "Network" tab, and set the throttling to "Offline." The connection status should go red. Now set it back to "Online." The connection should automatically re-establish and turn green within a few seconds.

### What's Next?

Your app is feature-complete and real-time. But how can we be sure it's reliable? In **Stage 10**, we'll dive deep into **Testing and Quality Assurance**, writing a comprehensive suite of automated tests to ensure our application is bulletproof.

Excellent questions\! This is a perfect example of moving from thinking about a "local script" to a "networked application." Let's break it down.

### 1\. Can I test it on one machine with two browsers?

**Yes, absolutely.** This is the primary way to test real-time features during development.

Here's why it works: Your `uvicorn` server is a single process listening on a port (e.g., `8000`) on your machine. Each browser window or tab you open is a separate **client**. When you navigate both to `http://localhost:8000`, they are both establishing independent connections to the _same_ server.

**How to do it:**

1.  Run your server as usual: `uvicorn backend.main:app --reload`
2.  Open your main browser (e.g., Chrome) and go to `http://localhost:8000`. Log in as `john`.
3.  Open a second browser (e.g., Firefox) or an Incognito/Private window in your main browser. Go to `http://localhost:8000` again. Log in as `admin`.
4.  Arrange the windows side-by-side. When you check out a file as `john`, you should see the UI in the `admin` window update instantly.

This simulates two different users interacting with your centralized server.

---

### 2\. Can I test it between my Mac and Windows machine?

**Yes\!** This is a fantastic way to test and a great opportunity to learn some networking basics. The process involves three key steps.

---

## A Quick Aside on Local Networking 🌐

To get your two machines talking to each other, the "client" machine (let's say, your Mac) needs to know the address of the "server" machine (your Windows PC). It can't use `localhost`, because that always means "this machine right here." Instead, it needs the **Local Network IP Address**.

#### Step 1: Find Your Server's Local IP Address

You need to find the IP address of the machine that will run the `uvicorn` server.

- **On Windows:**

  1.  Open PowerShell or Command Prompt.
  2.  Type `ipconfig`.
  3.  Look for your active network connection (usually "Wireless LAN adapter Wi-Fi" or "Ethernet adapter Ethernet"). Find the **IPv4 Address**. It will look something like `192.168.1.123`.

- **On macOS:**

  1.  Open the Terminal.
  2.  Type `ifconfig | grep "inet "`.
  3.  You'll see a few lines. Ignore the one that says `127.0.0.1`. Look for the other one, which is your local IP. It will also look something like `192.168.1.124`.

#### Step 2: Run the Server on `0.0.0.0`

By default, for security, `uvicorn` might run on `127.0.0.1` (localhost), which means it will _only_ accept connections from the same machine. To accept connections from other machines on your local network, you must tell it to listen on `0.0.0.0`.

On the server machine, run this command:

```bash
uvicorn backend.main:app --reload --host 0.0.0.0 --port 8000
```

`--host 0.0.0.0` means "listen for connections on all available network interfaces on this machine."

#### Step 3: Configure Your Firewall

This is the most common stumbling block. Your operating system's firewall will likely block incoming connections by default. You need to create an exception.

- **On Windows:**

  1.  The first time you run the server on `0.0.0.0`, the **Windows Defender Firewall** should pop up with a security alert for "Python."

  2.  **Crucially**, check the box for **"Private networks"** (and uncheck "Public networks" for better security).

  3.  Click **"Allow access"**.

  4.  If you miss the prompt, you can go to **Control Panel \> Windows Defender Firewall \> Allow an app or feature through Windows Defender Firewall** and ensure "Python" has a checkmark for Private networks.

- **On macOS:**

  1.  Go to **System Settings \> Network \> Firewall**.
  2.  Make sure the Firewall is on, then click **"Options..."**.
  3.  Click the **`+`** button, find "Python" or your terminal application (e.g., "Terminal" or "iTerm"), and add it.
  4.  Ensure it is set to "Allow incoming connections."

#### Step 4: Connect from the Other Machine

Now, on your second machine (the "client"), open a web browser. Instead of going to `localhost`, type the IP address of the server machine you found in Step 1, followed by the port.

For example, if your server PC's IP is `192.168.1.123`, you would navigate to:

**`http://192.168.1.123:8000`**

You should see your PDM application's login page\! You can now log in on both machines and test the WebSocket functionality across two separate physical devices on your network.

Excellent. Let's move on to one of the most critical stages in graduating from a coder to a software engineer: building a robust testing suite.

This stage is all about building confidence. With a good set of automated tests, you can refactor your code, add new features, and collaborate with others without the fear of unknowingly breaking something. We'll cover everything from the basic unit test to a full Continuous Integration (CI) pipeline.

Let's begin **Stage 10**.

---

# Stage 10: Testing & Quality Assurance - Building Bulletproof Software (Expanded & Unified)

## Introduction: The Goal of This Stage

Our application is now rich with features, but how do we guarantee they work correctly? How do we ensure that a bug fix for the `checkout` logic doesn't accidentally break the `upload` feature? The answer is **automated testing**.

In this stage, you will build a professional-grade testing suite for our PDM application.

---

### **🧠 Foundational Concepts: A Deeper Look**

- **Time Investment:** 6-8 hours.
- **The "Why" of Testing**: The cost of a bug increases exponentially the later it's found. A bug you catch while writing code costs seconds to fix. A bug a customer finds in production can cost hours of downtime and damage your reputation. Automated tests are your first and best line of defense.
- **The Testing Pyramid**: We will follow this industry-standard model:
  - **Unit Tests (Lots):** Fast tests that check a single function or class in isolation.
  - **Integration Tests (Some):** Slower tests that check how multiple parts of your system work together (e.g., does an API call correctly trigger a Git commit?).
  - **End-to-End Tests (Few):** Very slow tests that simulate a full user journey through the UI. (We will focus on the first two).
- **Further Reading**:
  - **The `pytest` Documentation**: An excellent resource for mastering the framework. [https://docs.pytest.org/](https://docs.pytest.org/)

---

## 10.1: Setting Up the Testing Environment

### **Step 1: Install Dependencies**

We need `pytest` and a few key plugins.

**In your activated virtual environment, run:**

```bash
pip install pytest pytest-asyncio pytest-cov
pip freeze > requirements.txt
```

- `pytest`: The testing framework.
- `pytest-asyncio`: A plugin that lets us test our `async` code and WebSockets.
- `pytest-cov`: A plugin for measuring "test coverage" (what percentage of our code is exercised by our tests).

### **Step 2: Create the Test Directory and Configuration**

`pytest` automatically discovers test files. Let's create a dedicated folder for them.

**In your `backend/` directory, run:**

```bash
mkdir tests
touch tests/__init__.py
touch tests/conftest.py
```

- `tests/`: The folder where all our test files will live.
- `conftest.py`: This is a special `pytest` file where we will define shared **fixtures** (helper functions for our tests).

**Now, create a `pytest.ini` file in your project root (`pdm-tutorial/`)** to standardize how we run our tests.

```ini
# pdm-tutorial/pytest.ini
[pytest]
# Tell pytest where to look for tests
testpaths = backend/tests

# Default command-line options
# -v: verbose output
# --cov=backend: measure test coverage for our 'backend' source code
# --cov-report=term-missing: show which lines of code are NOT covered by tests
# --cov-fail-under=80: CRITICAL - fail the entire test run if total coverage drops below 80%
addopts = -v --cov=backend --cov-report=term-missing --cov-fail-under=80
```

---

## 10.2: Test Fixtures - The Key to Clean Tests

A **fixture** is a function that `pytest` runs before a test to provide setup (like creating a temporary database or an authenticated user). This keeps our tests clean, simple, and DRY (Don't Repeat Yourself).

### **Step 1: Create Shared Fixtures in `conftest.py`**

Open `backend/tests/conftest.py` and add the following fixtures.

```python
# backend/tests/conftest.py

import pytest
from fastapi.testclient import TestClient
from pathlib import Path
import tempfile
import shutil

# This allows our tests to import from the main 'backend' directory
import sys
sys.path.insert(0, str(Path(__file__).resolve().parents[1]))

from main import app, User, get_current_user

@pytest.fixture(scope="session")
def client():
    """
    A TestClient instance that is shared across all tests in a session.
    This is our "virtual browser" for making API requests.
    """
    return TestClient(app)

@pytest.fixture(scope="function")
def temp_git_repo(monkeypatch):
    """
    This is a critical fixture. For each test that uses it, it:
    1. Creates a brand new, empty temporary directory.
    2. Tells our application (via 'monkeypatch') to use this temp directory
       as the GIT_REPO_PATH instead of the real one.
    3. Initializes a Git repo inside it.
    4. `yield`s the path to the test.
    5. After the test is done, it completely deletes the temporary directory.
    This ensures every test runs in a perfectly clean, isolated environment.
    """
    with tempfile.TemporaryDirectory() as temp_dir:
        # Override the application's global path constants during the test
        monkeypatch.setattr("main.GIT_REPO_PATH", Path(temp_dir))

        from main import initialize_git_repo
        repo = initialize_git_repo()
        yield repo

@pytest.fixture
def admin_token(client, temp_git_repo):
    """A fixture to get a valid JWT for the default 'admin' user."""
    from main import create_default_users
    create_default_users() # Ensure the user exists in our temp repo

    response = client.post("/api/auth/login", data={"username": "admin", "password": "admin123"})
    assert response.status_code == 200, "Failed to log in as admin"
    return response.json()["access_token"]

@pytest.fixture
def admin_headers(admin_token):
    """A fixture to provide the Authorization header for an admin user."""
    return {"Authorization": f"Bearer {admin_token}"}
```

---

## 10.3: Writing Unit and Integration Tests

Now let's write some tests using these fixtures.

### **Step 1: Create `test_auth.py`**

This file will hold tests related to authentication and authorization.

**Create `backend/tests/test_auth.py`:**

```python
# backend/tests/test_auth.py

from main import verify_password, pwd_context, app, get_current_user, User

def test_password_hashing():
    """
    Unit Test: Verifies that our password hashing logic works correctly in isolation.
    This test doesn't need any fixtures because it's testing a pure function.
    """
    # Arrange
    password = "a_very_secret_password"

    # Act
    hashed_password = pwd_context.hash(password)

    # Assert
    assert hashed_password != password
    assert verify_password(password, hashed_password) is True
    assert verify_password("wrong_password", hashed_password) is False

def test_login_endpoint(client, temp_git_repo):
    """
    Integration Test: Tests the full login flow via the API endpoint.
    Pytest automatically finds and injects the `client` and `temp_git_repo` fixtures.
    """
    # Arrange (the temp_git_repo fixture already created the default users)

    # Act
    response = client.post("/api/auth/login", data={"username": "admin", "password": "admin123"})

    # Assert
    assert response.status_code == 200
    data = response.json()
    assert "access_token" in data
    assert data["token_type"] == "bearer"

def test_delete_endpoint_permission_denied(client, temp_git_repo):
    """
    Integration Test: Ensures a non-admin user cannot access an admin-only route.
    This tests our `require_admin` dependency.
    """
    # Arrange: Log in as a regular user to get a valid token
    from main import create_default_users
    create_default_users()
    user_resp = client.post("/api/auth/login", data={"username": "john", "password": "password123"})
    user_token = user_resp.json()["access_token"]
    user_headers = {"Authorization": f"Bearer {user_token}"}

    # Act: Attempt to access an admin-only endpoint
    response = client.delete("/api/admin/files/some_file.mcam", headers=user_headers)

    # Assert: We should get a 403 Forbidden error
    assert response.status_code == 403
```

### **Step 2: Run Your Tests**

From your `backend` directory, simply run `pytest`.

```bash
pytest
```

Thanks to our `pytest.ini` file, this command will automatically find all your tests, run them, and report on your test coverage. You should see your tests passing\!

---

## 10.4: Mocking and Testing WebSockets

How do we test that a WebSocket broadcast happens without actually creating a live WebSocket connection? We use **mocking**. A mock is a "fake" object that we can substitute for a real one to record and inspect how it's used.

### **Step 1: Create `test_websockets.py`**

**Create `backend/tests/test_websockets.py`:**

```python
# backend/tests/test_websockets.py

import pytest
from unittest.mock import AsyncMock, patch

# The @pytest.mark.asyncio decorator is from the pytest-asyncio library.
# It tells pytest to run this test function inside an async event loop.
@pytest.mark.asyncio
async def test_broadcast_on_checkout(client, admin_headers, temp_git_repo):
    """
    Tests that a 'file_locked' event is broadcast when a file is checked out.
    """
    # Arrange: We use `patch` to temporarily replace the real `manager.broadcast`
    # function with a special mock object called an `AsyncMock`.
    with patch("main.manager.broadcast", new_callable=AsyncMock) as mock_broadcast:

        # Act: Make the API call that we expect to trigger the broadcast.
        client.post(
            "/api/files/checkout",
            headers=admin_headers,
            json={"filename": "sample.mcam", "user": "admin", "message": "test"}
        )

        # Assert: Check that our mock broadcast function was called exactly once.
        # `assert_awaited_once()` is the async version of `assert_called_once()`.
        mock_broadcast.assert_awaited_once()

        # We can even inspect the arguments it was called with.
        broadcast_message = mock_broadcast.call_args[0][0]
        assert broadcast_message["type"] == "file_locked"
        assert broadcast_message["filename"] == "sample.mcam"
```

This test gives us high confidence that our real-time system is working as intended, without the complexity and slowness of setting up real WebSocket clients.

---

## 10.5: Test-Driven Development (TDD)

TDD is a workflow where you write a failing test _before_ you write the application code. This forces you to think about requirements first and results in highly testable code.

**The Cycle:** **RED** (write a failing test) -\> **GREEN** (write minimal code to pass) -\> **REFACTOR** (clean up the code).

Let's build a new endpoint (`GET /api/users/me`) using TDD.

### **Step 1: RED - Write a failing test**

**Add to `test_auth.py`:**

```python
def test_get_own_profile(client, admin_headers, temp_git_repo):
    """TDD: Test for a new /api/users/me endpoint."""
    # Act: Request an endpoint that does not exist yet.
    response = client.get("/api/users/me", headers=admin_headers)

    # Assert: The test will fail here with a 404, which is what we want!
    assert response.status_code == 200
    data = response.json()
    assert data["username"] == "admin"
    assert data["role"] == "admin"
```

Run `pytest`. This test will fail. This is the **RED** phase.

### **Step 2: GREEN - Write the minimal code to pass**

**Add this new endpoint to `main.py`:**

```python
@app.get("/api/users/me", response_model=User)
async def read_users_me(current_user: User = Depends(get_current_user)):
    """Returns the profile of the currently authenticated user."""
    return current_user
```

Run `pytest` again. The test now passes. This is the **GREEN** phase.

### **Step 3: REFACTOR**

Our code is already quite clean, so there's not much to refactor. But this is the step where you would improve the implementation (e.g., add more data, optimize a query) while keeping the test green.

---

## 10.6: Continuous Integration (CI) with GitHub Actions

CI is the practice of automatically running your tests on a server every time you push new code. This provides a safety net for your entire team.

### **Step 1: Create the Workflow File**

Create the directory structure `.github/workflows/` in your **project root** (`pdm-tutorial/`).

**Create `.github/workflows/ci.yml`:**

```yaml
# .github/workflows/ci.yml
name: PDM Backend CI

on:
  push:
    branches: [main, develop]
  pull_request:
    branches: [main]

jobs:
  test:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest

    defaults:
      run:
        working-directory: ./backend

    steps:
      - name: Checkout repository
        uses: actions/checkout@v4

      - name: Set up Python 3.11
        uses: actions/setup-python@v5
        with:
          python-version: "3.11"

      - name: Install dependencies
        run: pip install -r requirements.txt

      - name: Run tests
        run: pytest # Pytest will automatically use our pytest.ini configuration
```

Commit and push this file to your GitLab/GitHub repository. Now, every time you push new code, go to the "Actions" (GitHub) or "CI/CD" (GitLab) tab. You'll see your workflow running your test suite automatically\! You can configure your repository to block merging pull requests until the CI pipeline passes, ensuring that no broken code ever reaches your `main` branch.

---

## Stage 10 Complete - A Bulletproof Application\!

You have now built a comprehensive testing suite and a professional CI pipeline. This is a massive step in ensuring your application's quality and your own confidence as a developer. You can now add features and refactor with a powerful safety net.

### What's Next?

Your application is feature-rich, secure, collaborative, and now, thoroughly tested. The final step is to prepare it for the real world. In **Stage 11**, we will tackle **Production Deployment**, containerizing the application with Docker and orchestrating the entire stack with Docker Compose.

Those are both excellent, insightful questions that get to the heart of professional testing strategies.

### 1\. Can we use OpenAPI for testing?

**Yes, absolutely\!** You've hit on a very powerful and modern testing technique called **schema-based testing**.

Since our `openapi.json` file is a perfect, machine-readable "contract" that describes exactly how our API should behave (endpoints, request data, response data, etc.), we can use tools that read this contract and **automatically generate hundreds of tests**.

These tools act like a creative but relentless quality assurance engineer. They'll test for:

- **Happy Paths**: Does the API work when I send valid data?
- **Negative Paths**: Does the API correctly reject data that's the wrong type (e.g., sending a string where an integer is expected)?
- **Edge Cases**: What happens if I send empty strings, very large numbers, or strange characters?

This is a form of **property-based testing** or **fuzzing**. It's incredibly effective at finding bugs you would never think to write a manual test for.

#### How It Works: A Mini-Tutorial with `schemathesis`

A popular Python library for this is called `schemathesis`. Let's see how easy it is.

1.  **Install it:**
    ```bash
    pip install schemathesis
    ```
2.  **Create a test file `test_schema.py`:**

    ```python
    # backend/tests/test_schema.py
    import schemathesis
    from ..main import app # Import our FastAPI app

    # Point schemathesis at our app's OpenAPI schema
    schema = schemathesis.from_asgi("/openapi.json", app)

    # This is the test "recipe" that pytest will use
    @schema.parametrize()
    def test_api(case):
        # The `case` object contains a single, auto-generated test scenario.
        # This one line will:
        # 1. Make a request to the app with the generated data.
        # 2. Validate that the response status code and content match the schema.
        case.call_and_validate()
    ```

3.  **Run it:**
    ```bash
    pytest backend/tests/test_schema.py
    ```

You'll see `pytest` run dozens or even hundreds of tests, throwing all sorts of valid and invalid data at your API to check for weaknesses.

**The Limitation:** Schema-based testing is fantastic for checking if your API adheres to its contract, but it **cannot test your business logic**. For example, it will confirm that `POST /api/files/checkout` returns a `200 OK` on a valid request, but it has no way of knowing if the `locks.json` file was _actually_ updated correctly.

**Conclusion:** Schema-based testing is a powerful _complement_ to the manual, logic-driven tests we write, not a replacement. It's an amazing safety net for catching unexpected inputs.

### 2\. Are we testing the frontend and backend?

Another great clarifying question. So far, with `pytest`, we have **only been testing the backend code**.

Here's the distinction:

#### Backend Testing (What we've done)

- **Tool**: `pytest` and `FastAPI.testclient.TestClient`.
- **How it works**: Our Python tests make in-memory HTTP requests directly to our FastAPI application. They send data (JSON, form data) and assert that the Python functions return the correct HTTP status codes and JSON responses.
- **What's NOT involved**: A web browser is never opened. None of our HTML, CSS, or JavaScript is ever loaded or executed. We are testing the "kitchen" in isolation.

#### Frontend Testing (A separate discipline)

Testing the UI is a whole other world. It typically involves a different set of tools that run in a Node.js environment and often control a real browser. Frontend testing is also broken down into a pyramid:

- **Unit Tests**: Testing individual JavaScript functions in isolation (e.g., "Does my `sortFiles()` function work correctly?").

  - **Tools**: **Jest**, **Vitest**.

- **Component Tests**: Testing a single UI component's appearance and behavior (e.g., "When I click the Theme Toggle button, does it correctly add the `data-theme` attribute to the HTML?").

  - **Tools**: **Vitest**, **React Testing Library**, **Vue Test Utils**.

- **End-to-End (E2E) Tests**: This is the highest level of testing. A script automates a real browser to simulate a full user journey.

  - **Tools**: **Cypress**, **Playwright**.

An E2E test for our app might look like this in pseudo-code:

```javascript
// This is what a Cypress E2E test might look like
it("should allow a user to log in and check out a file", () => {
  cy.visit("/login"); // 1. Open the login page
  cy.get("#username").type("john"); // 2. Find the input and type
  cy.get("#password").type("password123");
  cy.get("form").submit(); // 3. Submit the form

  cy.url().should("eq", "http://localhost:8000/"); // 4. Assert we were redirected

  cy.get(".file-item").first().find(".btn-checkout").click(); // 5. Click the checkout button on the first file

  cy.get("#checkout-modal").should("be.visible"); // 6. Assert that the modal appeared
  // ... and so on
});
```

We aren't including a frontend test suite in this tutorial to keep the scope focused, but it's the natural next step for ensuring the quality of a production-grade application.

- **Further Reading**:
  - **Cypress (E2E Testing)**: [https://www.cypress.io/](https://www.cypress.io/)
  - **Playwright (E2E Testing)**: [https://playwright.dev/](https://playwright.dev/)
  - **Vitest (Frontend Unit/Component Testing)**: [https://vitest.dev/](https://vitest.dev/)

That was an excellent set of questions. In summary: yes, we can auto-generate many backend tests from our OpenAPI schema, and no, `pytest` is not testing our frontend code.

With that clarified, are you ready to proceed with **Stage 11: Production Deployment**?

Excellent. This is the final and most comprehensive stage of our core tutorial. We're going to take the application we've built and tested on our local machine and package it for a real production deployment.

This stage brings together all the principles of a modern web application: configuration management, containerization, a production-grade database, and a reverse proxy. It's a dense stage, but by the end, you'll have a complete, deployable system.

Let's begin **Stage 11**.

---

That's a fantastic idea, and your timing is perfect. Understanding both raw SQL and how an ORM like SQLAlchemy works "under the hood" is a critical skill that truly separates a coder from a software engineer.

Before we move on, let's create a "Stage 11A" as a deep-dive prelude. We'll explore the power of SQL for querying relational data and then demystify what SQLAlchemy is doing for us. This knowledge is universal and will be incredibly helpful for your Java Spring class as well, since the core concepts of SQL and ORMs are language-agnostic.

---

# Stage 10B: Advanced Frontend - Refactoring for Performance & UX

## Introduction: The Goal of This Stage

Our application is feature-complete, but the frontend code could be more efficient and the user experience (UX) could be smoother. Currently, our `app.js` is growing, with global variables and functions that directly manipulate the DOM. This can become difficult to manage, a situation often called "spaghetti code."

In this stage, we will refactor our frontend to use professional patterns for state management, performance, and UI design.

---

### **🧠 Foundational Concepts: A Deeper Look**

- **State Management**: The "state" is all the data that describes your application at any given moment (the list of files, the current search term, which file is selected, etc.). **State management** is the practice of centralizing this data into a single, predictable "store" or "single source of truth." When the state changes, the UI automatically updates to reflect it. This is the core principle behind all modern frontend frameworks like React, Vue, and Angular.
- **The Observer Pattern**: This is a design pattern where an object (the "subject" or "store") maintains a list of dependents (the "observers," like our UI components) and notifies them automatically of any state changes. We will build a simple version of this.
- **Client-Side Caching**: Storing data in the browser to avoid unnecessary network requests. This makes the application feel significantly faster.

---

## 10B.1: The Great Refactor - Centralized State Management

Our biggest task is to stop scattering state in global variables (`allFiles`, `searchTerm`, etc.) and create a central "store."

### **Step 1: Create a Simple Store**

We'll create a simple object that holds our state and has a way to notify other parts of our code when the state changes.

**Add this new code to the top of `backend/static/js/app.js`:**

```javascript
// --- Centralized State Management (The "Store") ---

const store = {
  // 1. The state data itself
  state: {
    allFiles: [],
    isLoading: true,
    searchTerm: "",
    statusFilter: "all",
    sortBy: "name-asc",
    selectedFile: null,
  },

  // 2. A list of functions to call when the state changes
  _listeners: [],

  // 3. A method for UI components to "subscribe" to changes
  subscribe(listener) {
    this._listeners.push(listener);
  },

  // 4. A private method to notify all subscribers
  _notify() {
    // We pass a copy of the state to prevent accidental modification
    for (const listener of this._listeners) {
      listener({ ...this.state });
    }
  },

  // 5. Public methods ("actions") to safely change the state
  setFiles(files) {
    this.state.allFiles = files;
    this.state.isLoading = false;
    this._notify(); // Notify subscribers that the state has changed
  },

  setSearchTerm(term) {
    this.state.searchTerm = term;
    this._notify();
  },

  setSelectedFile(file) {
    this.state.selectedFile = file;
    this._notify();
  },

  setLoading() {
    this.state.isLoading = true;
    this._notify();
  },
  // (We would add setters for statusFilter, sortBy, etc. as well)
};
```

This simple object is a miniature version of a professional state management library like Redux or Vuex.

### **Step 2: Refactor `app.js` to Use the Store**

Now, let's update our functions to use this new store.

**Update `loadFiles` to use the `setFiles` action:**

```javascript
// REPLACE your old loadFiles function in app.js
async function loadFiles() {
  store.setLoading(); // Set loading state to true and notify UI

  try {
    const token = localStorage.getItem("access_token");
    const response = await fetch("/api/files", {
      headers: { Authorization: `Bearer ${token}` },
    });
    if (!response.ok) throw new Error("Failed to fetch files.");
    const data = await response.json();

    // Instead of a global variable, we use our store's action
    store.setFiles(data.files);
  } catch (error) {
    console.error("Error loading files:", error);
    // We can also add an error state to our store
  }
}
```

**Update `displayFiles` to be a "render" function that subscribes to the store:**

```javascript
// In app.js, find your DOMContentLoaded listener and replace its contents

document.addEventListener("DOMContentLoaded", () => {
  // ... (your existing event listeners for theme toggle, etc.) ...

  // --- Main Render Loop ---
  // We subscribe our main rendering function to the store.
  // Now, ANY time the state changes (via store.setFiles, etc.),
  // this function will automatically re-run and update the UI.
  store.subscribe((state) => {
    renderApp(state);
  });

  // Initial data load
  loadFiles();
});

// Create a new master render function
function renderApp(state) {
  const { allFiles, isLoading, searchTerm, statusFilter, sortBy } = state;

  // Show/hide loading indicator
  const loadingEl = document.getElementById("loading-indicator");
  loadingEl.classList.toggle("hidden", !isLoading);

  if (isLoading) {
    document.getElementById("file-list").innerHTML = "";
    return;
  }

  // Perform filtering and sorting (logic is the same as before)
  let processedFiles = allFiles
    .filter((file) => {
      /* ... filtering logic ... */
    })
    .sort((a, b) => {
      /* ... sorting logic ... */
    });

  // Render the file list
  const container = document.getElementById("file-list");
  container.innerHTML = "";
  if (processedFiles.length === 0) {
    container.innerHTML = "<p>No files match your criteria.</p>";
  } else {
    processedFiles.forEach((file) => {
      const fileElement = createFileElement(file, state.selectedFile); // Pass selectedFile
      container.appendChild(fileElement);
    });
  }
}
```

You've just implemented the core of modern frontend architecture\! Your UI now **reacts** to state changes automatically.

---

## 10B.2: A New UI Layout - The Side Panel

Let's use our new state management system to build a new feature. Instead of just listing files, let's show the details of a selected file in a side panel.

### **Step 1: Add HTML for the Side Panel**

**In `index.html`, modify your `<main>` section to have two columns:**

```html
<main class="container main-layout">
  <section id="file-list-section">
    <h2>File Dashboard</h2>
    <div id="loading-indicator" class="hidden"><p>Loading...</p></div>
    <div id="file-list"></div>
  </section>

  <aside id="details-panel" class="hidden">
    <button id="close-panel-btn">&times;</button>
    <div id="details-content"></div>
  </aside>
</main>
```

### **Step 2: Add CSS for the Layout**

**Add these styles to `components.css`:**

```css
.main-layout {
  display: grid;
  grid-template-columns: 1fr; /* Default to a single column on mobile */
  gap: var(--spacing-8);
}

/* On wider screens, use two columns */
@media (min-width: 1024px) {
  .main-layout {
    /* The `minmax` function creates a flexible and responsive sidebar */
    grid-template-columns: 1fr minmax(300px, 400px);
  }
}

#details-panel {
  position: relative; /* For the close button */
  background: var(--bg-secondary);
  border-radius: var(--card-border-radius);
  padding: var(--card-padding);
  border: 1px solid var(--border-default);
}

#close-panel-btn {
  position: absolute;
  top: var(--spacing-4);
  right: var(--spacing-4);
  /* ... (style it like your modal close button) ... */
}
```

### **Step 3: Wire It Up with JavaScript**

**Update `app.js`:**

```javascript
// In the createFileElement function, add a click listener to the main div
function createFileElement(file, selectedFile) {
  const div = document.createElement("div");
  div.className = "file-item";

  // Highlight the selected file
  if (selectedFile && selectedFile.name === file.name) {
    div.classList.add("selected");
  }

  div.addEventListener("click", () => {
    store.setSelectedFile(file);
  });

  // ... (rest of the function)
}

// In your main renderApp function, add logic to show/hide and render the panel
function renderApp(state) {
  // ... (existing code to render the file list) ...

  const detailsPanel = document.getElementById("details-panel");
  const detailsContent = document.getElementById("details-content");

  if (state.selectedFile) {
    detailsPanel.classList.remove("hidden");
    detailsContent.innerHTML = `
            <h3>${state.selectedFile.name}</h3>
            <p><strong>Status:</strong> ${state.selectedFile.status}</p>
            <p><strong>Locked by:</strong> ${
              state.selectedFile.locked_by || "N/A"
            }</p>
            <p><strong>Size:</strong> ${(
              state.selectedFile.size_bytes / 1024
            ).toFixed(2)} KB</p>
            `;
  } else {
    detailsPanel.classList.add("hidden");
  }
}

// Add a listener for the close button in DOMContentLoaded
document.getElementById("close-panel-btn").addEventListener("click", () => {
  store.setSelectedFile(null); // Setting selectedFile to null will hide the panel
});
```

_You'll also need a `.file-item.selected` style in `components.css` to highlight the active file._

**Checkpoint:** Refresh the page. Clicking on a file in the list should now open a details panel on the right with that file's information\! Clicking the 'x' or another file should update the panel accordingly. This demonstrates the power of a reactive state management system.

---

## 10B.3: UX Polish - Adding Tooltips

Tooltips are a great way to provide hints for UI elements without cluttering the screen. We can implement them with pure CSS.

### **Step 1: Add `data-tooltip` Attributes in HTML/JS**

In your `createFileElement` function, add a `data-tooltip` attribute to your buttons.

```javascript
// In app.js, inside createFileElement
const checkoutBtn = document.createElement("button");
checkoutBtn.className = "btn btn-checkout";
checkoutBtn.textContent = "Checkout";
checkoutBtn.setAttribute("data-tooltip", "Lock this file for editing"); // Add this line
checkoutBtn.onclick = () => handleCheckout(file.name);
```

### **Step 2: Add the Tooltip CSS**

**Add this to `components.css`:**

```css
[data-tooltip] {
  position: relative; /* Required for positioning the tooltip */
  cursor: help;
}

/* This creates the tooltip using the ::after pseudo-element */
[data-tooltip]::after {
  content: attr(data-tooltip); /* Use the attribute's content as the text */
  position: absolute;
  bottom: 100%; /* Position it above the element */
  left: 50%;
  transform: translateX(-50%) translateY(-8px); /* Center it and add some space */

  /* Styling */
  background: var(--bg-inverse);
  color: var(--text-inverse);
  padding: var(--spacing-2) var(--spacing-3);
  border-radius: var(--radius-base);
  font-size: var(--font-size-sm);
  white-space: nowrap; /* Prevent line breaks */

  /* Hide it by default */
  opacity: 0;
  pointer-events: none;
  transition: opacity var(--transition-fast), transform var(--transition-fast);
}

/* Show the tooltip on hover */
[data-tooltip]:hover::after {
  opacity: 1;
  transform: translateX(-50%) translateY(-4px);
}
```

**Checkpoint:** Refresh the page. Hover over a "Checkout" button. A clean, styled tooltip should appear\! You can now add tooltips to any element just by adding a `data-tooltip` attribute.

---

## Stage 10B Complete - A Refactored, Performant, and Polished UI\!

You've taken your functional frontend and elevated it to a professional level. It's now more maintainable, feels faster to the user, and has a much-improved user experience.

### What You've Accomplished

- **Refactored to a Central Store**: Your UI now reacts to a single source of truth, a pattern used in all modern frameworks.
- **Built New UI Components**: You added a responsive side panel that reacts to the application's state.
- **Improved UX**: You added elegant CSS-only tooltips.
- **Set the Stage for Performance**: You've laid the groundwork for client-side caching.

With this robust frontend, you are now truly ready to package everything for deployment.

Ready to proceed with **Stage 11** and deploy this to a production-like environment with Docker and PostgreSQL?

# Prelude to Stage 11: A Deep Dive into SQL and ORMs

## Part 1: Thinking in SQL - The Language of Data

You know the basics, so let's go deeper. At its heart, SQL (Structured Query Language) is a declarative language for interacting with **relational databases**. You declare _what_ data you want, and the database engine figures out the most efficient way to get it.

Our application's data is now stored in tables with defined relationships, like interconnected spreadsheets.

```
Table: users                     Table: file_locks
+----+----------+----------+      +----+---------------+---------+
| id | username | role     |      | id | filename      | user_id |
+----+----------+----------+      +----+---------------+---------+
| 1  | admin    | admin    |      | 1  | PN1001.mcam   | 2       |  <-- Foreign Key
| 2  | john     | user     |      | 2  | PN1002.mcam   | 2       |      points to users.id
+----+----------+----------+      +----+---------------+---------+
```

### The Most Powerful Command: `JOIN`

The magic of relational databases is the ability to connect data from multiple tables. This is done with `JOIN`.

Let's say we want a list of all locked files and the _name_ of the user who locked them. We can't get this from just one table. We need to join them.

```sql
SELECT
    file_locks.filename,
    users.username
FROM
    file_locks
INNER JOIN users ON file_locks.user_id = users.id;
```

- `INNER JOIN`: Returns only the rows where the join condition (`user_id = id`) is met.

| Join Type             | What It Does                                                                                                                                                                                                                             |
| :-------------------- | :--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **`INNER JOIN`**      | Returns rows only when there is a match in **both** tables.                                                                                                                                                                              |
| **`LEFT JOIN`**       | Returns **all** rows from the left table (`users`), and the matched rows from the right table (`file_locks`). If there's no match, the right side is `NULL`. (Useful for "find all users and show what files they have locked, if any"). |
| **`RIGHT JOIN`**      | The reverse of a `LEFT JOIN`. Returns all rows from the right table.                                                                                                                                                                     |
| **`FULL OUTER JOIN`** | Returns all rows when there is a match in one of the tables.                                                                                                                                                                             |

### Aggregation: Getting Insights from Data

`GROUP BY` allows you to collapse multiple rows into a summary row. It's almost always used with aggregate functions like `COUNT()`, `SUM()`, `AVG()`.

**Question:** "How many files has each user locked?"

```sql
SELECT
    users.username,
    COUNT(file_locks.id) AS files_locked_count
FROM
    users
LEFT JOIN file_locks ON users.id = file_locks.user_id
GROUP BY
    users.username
ORDER BY
    files_locked_count DESC;
```

- `COUNT(...)`: Counts the number of non-null rows.
- `AS`: Creates an alias for the new calculated column.
- `GROUP BY`: Collapses all rows for each `username` into a single summary row.
- `ORDER BY`: Sorts the final result.

### Transactions: The ACID Safety Net

As we discussed with our file lock, a transaction is a sequence of operations performed as a single logical unit of work. Relational databases provide this as a core feature, guaranteeing **ACID** properties (Atomicity, Consistency, Isolation, Durability).

In SQL, a transaction looks like this:

```sql
BEGIN; -- Start the transaction

-- Try to remove a lock
DELETE FROM file_locks WHERE filename = 'PN1001.mcam';

-- Try to log the action (let's pretend we have an audit table)
INSERT INTO audit_log (user, action) VALUES ('admin', 'delete lock');

-- If both operations succeeded without error, make them permanent.
COMMIT;

-- If an error had occurred, we would issue a ROLLBACK, and all changes
-- since BEGIN would be completely undone, as if they never happened.
```

This is a critical concept for maintaining data integrity.

---

## Part 2: Thinking in ORMs - SQLAlchemy

An **Object-Relational Mapper (ORM)** is a library that acts as a translator between your object-oriented code (Python classes) and a relational database (SQL tables).

### Why Use an ORM? The Pros and Cons

- **Pros**:
  - **Productivity**: You write Python, not SQL. It's often faster and more intuitive.
  - **Database Agnostic**: The same Python code can work with PostgreSQL, SQLite, or MySQL.
  - **Security**: ORMs automatically handle parameterization, which is the primary defense against **SQL Injection** attacks.
  - **OOP-Friendly**: You can work with objects and relationships (e.g., `my_lock.user.username`).
- **Cons**:
  - **Abstraction Leak**: You still need to understand SQL to write efficient queries and debug performance issues. An ORM can sometimes generate inefficient SQL.
  - **Complexity**: ORMs can have a steep learning curve of their own.

### SQLAlchemy: Mapping Python to SQL

Let's see how SQLAlchemy translates our Python code into the SQL we just learned.

#### The Session: Your Workspace

The **Session** object is the heart of SQLAlchemy's ORM. Think of it as a "workspace" or a "scratchpad." You load objects from the database into the session, you work with them as regular Python objects, and then you tell the session to `commit()` your changes. The session figures out the necessary `INSERT`, `UPDATE`, and `DELETE` statements for you. This is known as the **Unit of Work** pattern.

#### Querying (SELECT)

**Python (SQLAlchemy):**

```python
# Get a single user by username
user = db.query(models.User).filter(models.User.username == 'john').first()
```

**SQL Generated by SQLAlchemy:**

```sql
SELECT users.id, users.username, users.password_hash, users.full_name, users.role
FROM users
WHERE users.username = 'john'
LIMIT 1;
```

#### Joining

**Python (SQLAlchemy):**

```python
# Get all files locked by 'john'
locks = db.query(models.FileLock).join(models.User).filter(models.User.username == 'john').all()
```

**SQL Generated by SQLAlchemy:**

```sql
SELECT file_locks.id, file_locks.filename, file_locks.user_id, ...
FROM file_locks JOIN users ON users.id = file_locks.user_id
WHERE users.username = 'john';
```

#### Creating (INSERT)

**Python (SQLAlchemy):**

```python
new_user = models.User(username="jane", password_hash="...", full_name="Jane Doe", role="user")
db.add(new_user)
db.commit()
```

**SQL Generated by SQLAlchemy:**

```sql
BEGIN;
INSERT INTO users (username, password_hash, full_name, role) VALUES ('jane', '...', 'Jane Doe', 'user');
COMMIT;
```

Notice how `db.commit()` maps directly to a SQL `COMMIT`, wrapping the operation in a transaction.

#### The Power of `relationship()`

In `models.py`, we defined `user = relationship("User")` on our `FileLock` model. This tells SQLAlchemy about the foreign key link. This is what makes the ORM so powerful.

```python
# Get a FileLock object
lock = db.query(models.FileLock).filter(models.FileLock.filename == 'PN1001.mcam').first()

# Now, you can access the related user object directly!
if lock:
    print(f"File is locked by: {lock.user.username}")
```

You didn't have to write a `JOIN`\! SQLAlchemy sees you accessing `lock.user` and automatically (or "lazily") loads the related `User` object from the database for you. This is a huge productivity boost.

## Conclusion

You now have a solid understanding of both the raw power of SQL and the productive abstraction of an ORM. A true software engineer knows when to rely on the ORM for speed and safety, and when to drop down to raw SQL for performance tuning or complex reporting. This knowledge is your foundation for building data-driven applications.

With this deep dive complete, we are ready to proceed with the implementation of **Stage 11**.

# Stage 11: Production Deployment - Docker, PostgreSQL & Nginx (Expanded & Unified)

## Introduction: The Goal of This Stage

Our application runs perfectly on our development machine, but production is a different beast. We need consistency, security, and scalability. This stage is about bridging that gap, using a professional toolchain to prepare our app for the real world.

By the end of this stage, you will:

- Manage all application configuration securely using **environment variables**.
- Containerize the application with **Docker** into a portable, reproducible image.
- Migrate your data from JSON files to a robust **PostgreSQL** database.
- Use **Docker Compose** to define and run your entire multi-container stack (app, database, web server).
- Configure **Nginx** as a high-performance reverse proxy.

---

### **🧠 Foundational Concepts: A Deeper Look**

- **Time Investment:** 8-10 hours.
- **The 12-Factor App Methodology**: This is our guiding philosophy for this stage. It's a set of best practices for building modern, cloud-native applications. We will focus heavily on **Factor III: Config** (storing config in the environment) and **Factor X: Dev/Prod Parity** (keeping development and production as similar as possible, which Docker helps us achieve).
- **CS Topic: Containers vs. Virtual Machines**:
  - A **Virtual Machine (VM)** virtualizes the hardware, running a full guest operating system on top of a host OS. They are heavy and slow to start.
  - A **Container** virtualizes the _operating system_. Multiple containers run on the _same_ host OS kernel, but each has its own isolated filesystem, process space, and network interface. They are incredibly lightweight and fast. Docker is the most popular containerization technology.

## 11.1: Secure Configuration with Environment Variables

Hardcoding secrets like your `SECRET_KEY` in the code is a major security risk. We must externalize all configuration.

### **Step 1: Install `pydantic-settings`**

This library allows us to define our configuration in a Pydantic model and automatically load it from environment variables or a `.env` file.

```bash
pip install pydantic-settings
pip freeze > requirements.txt
```

### **Step 2: Create a `config.py` Module**

**Create a new file `backend/config.py`:**

```python
# backend/config.py
from pydantic_settings import BaseSettings

class Settings(BaseSettings):
    """
    Application settings loaded from environment variables or a .env file.
    Pydantic automatically validates and casts the types (e.g., string "30" becomes int 30).
    """
    # A default value is used if the env var is not set.
    DEBUG: bool = False

    # A field with no default is REQUIRED. The app will fail to start if it's not set.
    SECRET_KEY: str

    ACCESS_TOKEN_EXPIRE_MINUTES: int = 30
    ALGORITHM: str = "HS256"

    # The connection string for our database.
    DATABASE_URL: str

    class Config:
        # This tells Pydantic to try loading variables from a file named .env
        env_file = ".env"

# Create a single, cached instance of the settings that our app will import.
settings = Settings()
```

### **Step 3: Create `.env` Files**

- **`.env`** holds your local development secrets and should **never** be committed to Git.
- **`.env.example`** is a template that **should** be committed to Git.

**Create `backend/.env.example` (Commit this):**

```
# Template for environment variables.
# Copy to .env for local development, or set these in your production environment.
SECRET_KEY=
DATABASE_URL=
```

**Create `backend/.env` (DO NOT commit this):**

```
# Local development secrets for the PDM App
SECRET_KEY="a-very-long-and-random-secret-key-for-development"
# We'll use a local PostgreSQL database via Docker later.
DATABASE_URL="postgresql://pdm_user:pdm_pass@localhost:5432/pdm_db"
```

**CRITICAL: Add `.env` to your `.gitignore` file now\!**

### **Step 4: Refactor `main.py`**

Now, replace all hardcoded configuration values in `main.py` with references to your new `settings` object.

```python
# In main.py
# ADD this import at the top
from config import settings

# REPLACE the old JWT constants with these lines:
SECRET_KEY = settings.SECRET_KEY
ALGORITHM = settings.ALGORITHM
ACCESS_TOKEN_EXPIRE_MINUTES = settings.ACCESS_TOKEN_EXPIRE_MINUTES

# We will use settings.DATABASE_URL in the next step.
```

---

## 11.2: Migrating to PostgreSQL

JSON files are not suitable for a production application that requires data integrity and concurrent access. We will migrate our user and lock data to a PostgreSQL database.

### **Step 1: Install Database Libraries**

```bash
pip install sqlalchemy psycopg2-binary alembic
pip freeze > requirements.txt
```

- **SQLAlchemy**: The premier Object-Relational Mapper (ORM) for Python. It lets us work with database tables as if they were Python classes.
- **psycopg2-binary**: The driver that allows Python to communicate with PostgreSQL.
- **Alembic**: A database migration tool that's like "Git for your database schema."

### **Step 2: Define Database Models**

**Create a new file `backend/models.py`:**

```python
# backend/models.py
from sqlalchemy import Column, Integer, String, DateTime, ForeignKey
from sqlalchemy.orm import declarative_base, relationship
from datetime import datetime, timezone

Base = declarative_base()

class User(Base):
    __tablename__ = "users"
    id = Column(Integer, primary_key=True, index=True)
    username = Column(String, unique=True, index=True, nullable=False)
    password_hash = Column(String, nullable=False)
    full_name = Column(String)
    role = Column(String, default="user", nullable=False)

class FileLock(Base):
    __tablename__ = "file_locks"
    id = Column(Integer, primary_key=True, index=True)
    filename = Column(String, unique=True, index=True, nullable=False)
    user_id = Column(Integer, ForeignKey("users.id"), nullable=False)
    locked_at = Column(DateTime, default=lambda: datetime.now(timezone.utc))
    message = Column(String)
    user = relationship("User")
```

### **Step 3: Set Up the Database Connection**

**Create a new file `backend/database.py`:**

```python
# backend/database.py
from sqlalchemy import create_engine
from sqlalchemy.orm import sessionmaker
from config import settings

# The engine is the entry point to the database.
# The connection string comes from our settings.
engine = create_engine(settings.DATABASE_URL)

# A SessionLocal class is a factory for creating new database sessions.
SessionLocal = sessionmaker(autocommit=False, autoflush=False, bind=engine)

def get_db():
    """A FastAPI dependency to provide a database session per request."""
    db = SessionLocal()
    try:
        yield db
    finally:
        db.close()
```

### **Step 4: Configure and Run Migrations with Alembic**

1.  **Initialize Alembic** (run once in the `backend` directory):

    ```bash
    alembic init alembic
    ```

2.  **Configure `alembic/env.py`**:

    - Add these imports at the top:
      ```python
      from models import Base
      from config import settings
      target_metadata = Base.metadata
      ```
    - Find the `sqlalchemy.url` line and change it to:
      ```python
      config.set_main_option('sqlalchemy.url', settings.DATABASE_URL)
      ```

3.  **Generate your first migration script**:

    ```bash
    alembic revision --autogenerate -m "Create initial user and lock tables"
    ```

    This compares your `models.py` to the (empty) database and generates a Python script in `alembic/versions/` that knows how to create your tables.

4.  **Apply the migration** (we will automate this with Docker Compose later):

    ```bash
    alembic upgrade head
    ```

    This runs the script and creates the tables in your database.

## 11.3: Containerizing with Docker and Docker Compose

Now we'll package our entire application stack into containers.

### **Step 1: The Multi-Stage `Dockerfile`**

A multi-stage build is a best practice that results in a smaller, more secure final image by discarding build-time dependencies.

**Create `backend/Dockerfile`:**

```dockerfile
# backend/Dockerfile

# --- Stage 1: The "Builder" ---
# This stage installs dependencies, including any tools needed to compile them.
FROM python:3.11-slim as builder

WORKDIR /app

# Install dependencies into a virtual environment
COPY requirements.txt .
RUN python -m venv /opt/venv
ENV PATH="/opt/venv/bin:$PATH"
RUN pip install -r requirements.txt


# --- Stage 2: The Final Production Image ---
# This is the lean image we will actually deploy.
FROM python:3.11-slim

WORKDIR /app

# Copy the pre-installed virtual environment from the builder stage.
COPY --from=builder /opt/venv /opt/venv

# Copy the application source code
COPY . .

# Set the PATH to use the virtual environment's executables
ENV PATH="/opt/venv/bin:$PATH"

# Run as a non-root user for security
RUN useradd --create-home appuser
USER appuser

# Expose the port the app runs on
EXPOSE 8000

# The command to run the app using Gunicorn, a production-grade server
CMD ["gunicorn", "-w", "4", "-k", "uvicorn.workers.UvicornWorker", "--bind", "0.0.0.0:8000", "main:app"]
```

### **Step 2: The `docker-compose.yml` File**

This file defines and orchestrates our multi-container application: our Python app, a PostgreSQL database, and an Nginx web server.

**Create `docker-compose.yml` in your project root (`pdm-tutorial/`):**

```yaml
version: "3.9"

services:
  db:
    image: postgres:15-alpine
    volumes:
      - postgres_data:/var/lib/postgresql/data/
    environment:
      - POSTGRES_USER=pdm_user
      - POSTGRES_PASSWORD=pdm_pass
      - POSTGRES_DB=pdm_db
    healthcheck:
      test: ["CMD-SHELL", "pg_isready -U pdm_user -d pdm_db"]
      interval: 5s
      timeout: 5s
      retries: 5

  app:
    build: ./backend
    volumes:
      - git_data:/app/git_repo
    ports:
      - "8000:8000"
    env_file:
      - ./backend/.env # Load environment variables from our .env file
    depends_on:
      db:
        condition: service_healthy
    command: bash -c "alembic upgrade head && gunicorn -w 4 -k uvicorn.workers.UvicornWorker --bind 0.0.0.0:8000 main:app"

  nginx:
    image: nginx:latest
    ports:
      - "80:80"
    volumes:
      - ./nginx.conf:/etc/nginx/nginx.conf:ro
      - ./backend/static:/static_files:ro
    depends_on:
      - app

volumes:
  postgres_data:
  git_data:
```

### **Step 3: The `nginx.conf` File**

Nginx will be our "reverse proxy." It will receive all incoming traffic and route it appropriately.

**Create `nginx.conf` in your project root (`pdm-tutorial/`):**

```nginx
events {}
http {
    server {
        listen 80;

        location /static/ {
            alias /static_files/;
        }

        location /ws {
            proxy_pass http://app:8000;
            proxy_http_version 1.1;
            proxy_set_header Upgrade $http_upgrade;
            proxy_set_header Connection "upgrade";
            proxy_set_header Host $host;
        }

        location / {
            proxy_pass http://app:8000;
            proxy_set_header Host $host;
        }
    }
}
```

---

## Stage 11 Complete - A Production-Ready System\!

You have now fully containerized your application and migrated to a production-grade database.

### Run Your Full Stack

From your project root directory (`pdm-tutorial/`), run the magic command:

```bash
docker-compose up -d --build
```

- `-d`: Run in detached (background) mode.
- `--build`: Rebuild your `app` image if the code has changed.

Your entire PDM application—the FastAPI server, the PostgreSQL database, and the Nginx proxy—is now running. You can access it at `http://localhost`.

### Verification Checklist

- [ ] You have refactored `main.py` to use the `settings` object.
- [ ] You have created `models.py` and set up Alembic.
- [ ] You have refactored your user/lock functions to use the database via SQLAlchemy.
- [ ] Your `Dockerfile`, `docker-compose.yml`, and `nginx.conf` files are in place.
- [ ] `docker-compose up` starts all three containers without errors.
- [ ] You can access the application at `http://localhost`, log in, and interact with it.
- [ ] Data persists. If you run `docker-compose down` and then `docker-compose up` again, your users and locks are still there.

### What's Next?

Your application is architected for production. The final step is to secure it for the public internet. The next optional stages would cover:

- **Stage 12: HTTPS & SSL/TLS**: Securing your Nginx proxy with free certificates from Let's Encrypt.
- **Stage 13: Caching & Performance**: Adding a Redis cache to speed up common database queries.
- That's an excellent instinct, and you're thinking like a senior developer. Before packaging an application for its final deployment, it's crucial to pause and refactor. Cleaning up the code, improving the user experience, and optimizing performance now will pay huge dividends later.

You're right to want to break this down. Let's create a new, dedicated stage for this process. We'll call it **Stage 10B: Advanced Frontend Refactoring**. We will tackle each of your points step-by-step, building on the code we have to make it significantly better.

Of course. We've built a powerful, containerized application stack. The final step to make it truly production-ready is to secure the communication between our users and the server.

This stage is a deep dive into web security's most fundamental layer: encryption. We'll explore the cryptography that powers the modern web and implement it for our application using free, automated tools.

Let's begin **Stage 12**.

---

# Stage 12: HTTPS & Production Security (Expanded & Unified)

## Introduction: The Goal of This Stage

Our application currently communicates over **HTTP**, which is unencrypted plain text. Any attacker on the network between your user and your server can read everything—passwords, session tokens, and all the data your app transmits. For a production application, this is unacceptable.

In this stage, you will secure your application by implementing **HTTPS** (HTTP Secure), encrypting all traffic with an SSL/TLS certificate from **Let's Encrypt**.

---

### **🧠 Foundational Concepts: A Deeper Look**

- **Time Investment:** 4-6 hours (plus DNS propagation time).
- **CS Topic: Public Key Cryptography (Asymmetric Cryptography)**. This is the cryptographic magic that makes HTTPS possible. It involves a **key pair**:
  - A **Private Key**, which the server keeps absolutely secret.
  - A **Public Key**, which the server shares freely with anyone who connects.
    Data encrypted with the public key can _only_ be decrypted by the private key. During the initial "handshake," the client and server use this key pair to securely agree upon a shared symmetric key, which is then used to encrypt all subsequent communication.
- **CS Topic: The Chain of Trust**. How does your browser know it can trust the public key sent by `pdm-app.com`? It's because the server's **SSL Certificate** (which contains its public key) is digitally signed by a trusted **Certificate Authority (CA)**, like Let's Encrypt. Your browser has a pre-installed list of trusted Root CAs. It verifies the signature on the certificate, creating a chain of trust back to a root it already knows. This entire framework is called a **Public Key Infrastructure (PKI)**.
- **Further Reading**:
  - **How HTTPS Works**: A fantastic, illustrated guide. [https://howhttps.works/](https://howhttps.works/)
  - **Let's Encrypt**: The free, automated Certificate Authority we will use. [https://letsencrypt.org/](https://letsencrypt.org/)

---

## 12.1: Prerequisites - A Domain Name

To get a valid SSL certificate, you need a registered domain name (e.g., `mypdm-app.com`). You cannot get a valid certificate for a raw IP address or for `localhost`.

1.  **Get a Domain Name**: If you don't have one, you can register one from a provider like Namecheap, GoDaddy, or Google Domains.
2.  **Point DNS to Your Server**: You need to log into your domain provider's DNS management panel and create an **`A` record**. This record points your domain to your server's public IP address.
    - **Host**: `@` (which means the root domain, `mypdm-app.com`)
    - **Value**: `YOUR_SERVER_PUBLIC_IP_ADDRESS`
3.  **Wait for Propagation**: It can take anywhere from a few minutes to a few hours for this DNS change to propagate across the internet. You can use a tool like [whatsmydns.net](https://whatsmydns.net) to check the status.

---

## 12.2: The Strategy - Using Certbot with Nginx

We will use **Certbot**, a free tool from the EFF, to automatically obtain and renew our SSL certificates from Let's Encrypt. Our strategy will be:

1.  Run Certbot in its own Docker container.
2.  Use the `HTTP-01` challenge method: Certbot will place a special file in a web-accessible directory.
3.  Let's Encrypt's servers will make an HTTP request to our domain to verify that the file is there, proving we control the domain.
4.  Nginx will serve this challenge file.
5.  Once the certificate is issued, Nginx will be configured to use it to serve all traffic over HTTPS.

## 12.3: Updating Docker Compose for Certbot

We need to add a new service for Certbot to our `docker-compose.yml` and share volumes with Nginx.

**Update your `docker-compose.yml` in the project root:**

```yaml
version: "3.9"

services:
  # (Your existing 'db' and 'app' services remain the same)
  db:
    # ...
  app:
    # ...

  nginx:
    image: nginx:latest
    ports:
      - "80:80"
      - "443:443" # We now need to expose the HTTPS port
    volumes:
      - ./nginx.conf:/etc/nginx/nginx.conf:ro
      - ./backend/static:/static_files:ro
      # --- ADD THESE TWO NEW VOLUMES ---
      # Share the certificate data with Nginx
      - certbot_certs:/etc/letsencrypt
      # Share the webroot directory for the ACME challenge
      - certbot_webroot:/var/www/certbot
    depends_on:
      - app

  # --- ADD THIS NEW CERTBOT SERVICE ---
  certbot:
    image: certbot/certbot
    volumes:
      - certbot_certs:/etc/letsencrypt
      - certbot_webroot:/var/www/certbot
    # The command will depend on whether we're issuing or renewing
    command: ["--version"] # Placeholder command

volumes:
  postgres_data:
  git_data:
  # --- ADD THESE NEW NAMED VOLUMES ---
  certbot_certs:
  certbot_webroot:
```

- **Named Volumes**: `certbot_certs` and `certbot_webroot` are named volumes managed by Docker. This is the correct way to share data between containers (`certbot` and `nginx`).

---

## 12.4: Updating the Nginx Configuration

We'll update `nginx.conf` to handle both the initial HTTP challenge and the final HTTPS traffic.

**Replace the contents of your `nginx.conf` with this:**

```nginx
# pdm-tutorial/nginx.conf
events {}
http {
    server {
        listen 80;
        # IMPORTANT: Replace these with your actual domain name
        server_name your-domain.com www.your-domain.com;

        # This location block handles the Let's Encrypt challenge
        location /.well-known/acme-challenge/ {
            root /var/www/certbot;
        }

        # For all other HTTP traffic, redirect to HTTPS
        location / {
            return 301 https://$host$request_uri;
        }
    }

    server {
        listen 443 ssl http2;
        server_name your-domain.com www.your-domain.com;

        # Paths to the certificates that Certbot will create
        ssl_certificate /etc/letsencrypt/live/your-domain.com/fullchain.pem;
        ssl_certificate_key /etc/letsencrypt/live/your-domain.com/privkey.pem;

        # Modern, secure SSL configuration
        include /etc/letsencrypt/options-ssl-nginx.conf;
        ssl_dhparam /etc/letsencrypt/ssl-dhparams.pem;

        location /static/ {
            alias /static_files/;
        }

        location /ws {
            proxy_pass http://app:8000;
            proxy_http_version 1.1;
            proxy_set_header Upgrade $http_upgrade;
            proxy_set_header Connection "upgrade";
            proxy_set_header Host $host;
        }

        location / {
            proxy_pass http://app:8000;
            proxy_set_header Host $host;
        }
    }
}
```

**CRITICAL:** Replace `your-domain.com` with your actual domain name in **three** places in this file.

---

## 12.5: Issuing the First Certificate

This is a multi-step, one-time process.

### **Step 1: Get Recommended SSL Configs**

Certbot provides recommended, secure configuration files. We need to download them first.

```bash
# Create dummy folders for the certificates so Nginx can start
mkdir -p ./certbot/conf/live/your-domain.com

# Start Nginx temporarily
docker-compose up -d nginx

# Download the recommended SSL options
docker-compose exec nginx wget https://raw.githubusercontent.com/certbot/certbot/master/certbot-nginx/certbot_nginx/_internal/tls_configs/options-ssl-nginx.conf -O /etc/letsencrypt/options-ssl-nginx.conf

# Generate strong Diffie-Hellman parameters (this can take a few minutes)
docker-compose exec nginx openssl dhparam -out /etc/letsencrypt/ssl-dhparams.pem 2048

# Stop Nginx for now
docker-compose down
```

### **Step 2: Run Certbot to Get the Certificate**

Now we'll run the `certbot` container, telling it to get a certificate using the `webroot` method.

```bash
docker-compose run --rm certbot certonly \
    --webroot \
    --webroot-path /var/www/certbot \
    --email your-email@example.com \
    --agree-tos \
    --no-eff-email \
    --force-renewal \
    -d your-domain.com \
    -d www.your-domain.com
```

- Replace `your-email@example.com` and the domains with your own.
- Certbot will communicate with Let's Encrypt and place the challenge file in the `certbot_webroot` volume. Nginx (which is running) will serve this file, Let's Encrypt will verify it, and the certificate will be issued and placed in the `certbot_certs` volume.

### **Step 3: Start the Full Stack**

If the command above was successful, your certificates are now in place. You can now start your entire application stack.

```bash
docker-compose up -d --build
```

Navigate to `https://your-domain.com`. You should see your application, now served securely with a 🔒 lock icon in the browser\!

---

## 12.6: Automating Certificate Renewal

Let's Encrypt certificates are only valid for 90 days. We need to automate their renewal. We'll do this by updating the `command` for our `certbot` service in `docker-compose.yml`.

**Update the `certbot` service in `docker-compose.yml`:**

```yaml
certbot:
  image: certbot/certbot
  volumes:
    - certbot_certs:/etc/letsencrypt
    - certbot_webroot:/var/www/certbot
  # This command will run 'certbot renew' every 12 hours.
  # Certbot is smart and will only actually renew if the certificate is close to expiring.
  command: renew --webroot -w /var/www/certbot --quiet
```

Your certificates will now be renewed automatically in the background. Nginx will need to be reloaded to pick up the new certificate. You can do this with a cron job on your server that runs `docker-compose exec nginx nginx -s reload`.

---

## Stage 12 Complete - A Secure, Production-Grade Deployment\!

You have successfully secured your application with HTTPS, implemented automated certificate renewals, and configured a professional-grade web server setup.

### Verification Checklist

- [ ] Visiting `http://your-domain.com` automatically redirects to `https://your-domain.com`.
- [ ] Your browser shows a 🔒 secure lock icon with no warnings.
- [ ] All application features, including WebSockets (which now use `wss://`), work correctly over HTTPS.
- [ ] You can run the `certbot renew --dry-run` command to simulate a successful renewal.
- [ ] You can test your domain on a site like **SSL Labs** ([https://www.ssllabs.com/ssltest/](https://www.ssllabs.com/ssltest/)) and get an "A" rating.

### What's Next?

Your application is fully architected, secure, and ready for the world. The journey from a simple script to a production-ready system is complete. From here, you can continue to add features, improve performance with caching (Stage 13), or explore deploying this stack to a cloud provider. Congratulations\!

Excellent. Now that we have a production-grade, containerized application, let's focus on a critical aspect of performance and scalability: **caching**.

This stage is a deep dive into using Redis, an incredibly fast in-memory data store, to speed up our application and reduce the load on our database. This is a standard technique used in almost every high-performance web application.

Let's begin **Stage 13**.

---

# Stage 13: Performance Caching with Redis (Expanded & Unified)

## Introduction: The Goal of This Stage

Our application currently queries the database or scans the filesystem for every single request that needs data. For the file list, this is relatively fast now, but what if we had 10,000 files? Or 1,000 users making requests every second? The database would quickly become a bottleneck, and our application would slow down.

In this stage, you will implement a **caching layer** using **Redis**. A cache is a high-speed, temporary storage that holds frequently accessed data, allowing us to serve requests from memory instead of hitting the slower database every time.

---

### **🧠 Foundational Concepts: A Deeper Look**

- **Time Investment:** 3-5 hours.
- **What is Redis?** Redis (REmote DIctionary Server) is an open-source, in-memory, key-value data store.
  - **In-Memory**: It keeps the entire dataset in RAM, which is why it's lightning-fast (sub-millisecond latency).
  - **Key-Value**: At its simplest, you `SET` a value for a given `key` and `GET` it back later.
  - **Analogy**: If PostgreSQL is your comprehensive, organized library (durable, on disk, slower to search), Redis is the whiteboard next to your desk where you jot down frequently needed information for instant access.
- **CS Topic: Caching Strategies**. The most common caching pattern, and the one we will implement, is **Cache-Aside (or Lazy Loading)**.
  1.  Your application receives a request for data.
  2.  It first checks the **cache** (Redis) for this data.
  3.  **Cache Hit**: If the data is in the cache, it's returned immediately to the user. The database is never touched.
  4.  **Cache Miss**: If the data is _not_ in the cache, the application queries the **database** (the source of truth).
  5.  The application then **stores** a copy of this data in the cache before returning it to the user.
  6.  The next request for the same data will be a cache hit.
- **The Hardest Problem: Cache Invalidation**. When data changes in your main database, you must update or remove the corresponding data in your cache. If you don't, you will be serving stale, incorrect information. We will implement an explicit invalidation strategy.
- **Further Reading**:
  - **Redis Official Website**: [https://redis.io/](https://redis.io/)
  - **Caching Patterns and Best Practices**: A great overview of different strategies. [https://aws.amazon.com/caching/caching-patterns/](https://www.google.com/search?q=https://aws.amazon.com/caching/caching-patterns/)

---

## 13.1: Setting Up Redis in Our Stack

### **Step 1: Add Redis to Docker Compose**

First, we need to add a Redis container to our application stack.

**Update your `docker-compose.yml` file in the project root:**

```yaml
# pdm-tutorial/docker-compose.yml
version: "3.9"

services:
  # (Your existing 'db', 'app', and 'nginx' services remain the same)
  db:
    # ...
  app:
    # ...
    depends_on:
      db:
        condition: service_healthy
      redis: # Add a dependency on the new Redis service
        condition: service_healthy
  nginx:
    # ...

  # --- ADD THIS NEW REDIS SERVICE ---
  redis:
    image: redis:7-alpine # Use the official, lightweight Redis image
    container_name: pdm-redis
    healthcheck:
      # This command asks the Redis server if it's ready to accept connections
      test: ["CMD", "redis-cli", "ping"]
      interval: 5s
      timeout: 5s
      retries: 5

volumes:
  # (Your existing volumes remain the same)
  postgres_data:
  git_data:
```

### **Step 2: Install the Python Redis Client**

Our Python application needs a library to communicate with the Redis server.

**In your activated virtual environment, run:**

```bash
pip install redis
pip freeze > requirements.txt
```

### **Step 3: Configure the Redis Connection**

Let's centralize our Redis connection logic.

**Add a `REDIS_URL` to your `backend/.env` file:**

```
# backend/.env
# ... (existing variables)
DATABASE_URL="postgresql://pdm_user:pdm_pass@db:5432/pdm_db" # Note: use 'db' hostname for Docker
REDIS_URL="redis://redis:6379" # Use the service name 'redis' as the hostname
```

_Note: We updated `DATABASE_URL` to use the service name `db` instead of `localhost` so the `app` container can find the `db` container._

**Update your `backend/config.py` to include the new setting:**

```python
# backend/config.py
class Settings(BaseSettings):
    # ... (existing settings)
    DATABASE_URL: str
    REDIS_URL: str # Add this line
    # ...
```

**Create a new file `backend/redis_client.py`:**

```python
# backend/redis_client.py
import redis
from config import settings

# This creates a connection pool and a Redis client that can be imported
# by other parts of our application.
redis_client = redis.from_url(settings.REDIS_URL, decode_responses=True)
```

_`decode_responses=True` is a convenience that makes the client return strings instead of bytes, which is easier to work with._

---

## 13.2: A Playground for Redis Commands

Before we integrate Redis into our app, let's play with it directly to understand how it works.

#### 🏋️ Practice Exercise: The Redis Sandbox

**Create a new file `backend/redis_playground.py`:**

```python
# backend/redis_playground.py
import redis
import json

# Connect to the Redis container. Make sure your stack is running!
# Note: For a local script, we connect to localhost. Inside our app container, we'd use 'redis'.
redis_client = redis.from_url("redis://localhost:6379", decode_responses=True)

def run_demo():
    print("--- Redis Playground ---")

    # 1. Basic Key-Value
    print("\n1. Setting a simple key...")
    redis_client.set("greeting", "Hello, Redis!")
    value = redis_client.get("greeting")
    print(f"   GET 'greeting': {value}")

    # 2. TTL (Time-To-Live)
    print("\n2. Setting a key with a 10-second expiration...")
    redis_client.setex("temporary_key", 10, "This will disappear soon.")
    print(f"   GET 'temporary_key': {redis_client.get('temporary_key')}")
    print("   (Wait 10 seconds and this key will be gone)")

    # 3. Storing JSON
    # Redis only stores strings, so we must serialize complex data like JSON.
    print("\n3. Storing a Python dictionary as a JSON string...")
    user_data = {"id": 1, "username": "admin", "role": "admin"}
    redis_client.set("user:1", json.dumps(user_data))

    # When we get it back, we need to deserialize it.
    user_json = redis_client.get("user:1")
    retrieved_user = json.loads(user_json)
    print(f"   Retrieved user role: {retrieved_user['role']}")

    # 4. Deleting keys
    print("\n4. Deleting the 'greeting' key...")
    redis_client.delete("greeting")
    print(f"   GET 'greeting' after delete: {redis_client.get('greeting')}") # Will be None

if __name__ == "__main__":
    # First, make sure the Redis server is responsive.
    try:
        if redis_client.ping():
            print("Successfully connected to Redis!")
            run_demo()
        else:
            print("Could not connect to Redis.")
    except redis.exceptions.ConnectionError as e:
        print(f"Connection Error: Is your Docker Compose stack running? ({e})")
```

**To run this:**

1.  Start your full application stack: `docker-compose up -d`
2.  Run the playground script: `python backend/redis_playground.py`

You'll see the output of the basic Redis commands, demonstrating how to set, get, expire, and delete keys.

## 13.3: Caching the File List (Cache-Aside Pattern)

Now let's apply the Cache-Aside pattern to our busiest endpoint: `/api/files`.

**Update your `get_files` endpoint in `main.py`:**

```python
# First, add this import at the top of main.py
from redis_client import redis_client

# REPLACE your old get_files function with this one
@app.get("/api/files")
def get_files(current_user: User = Depends(get_current_user)):
    # Define a unique key for this cache entry
    cache_key = "pdm:files_list"

    # 1. Try to get the data from the cache first.
    cached_files = redis_client.get(cache_key)

    if cached_files:
        logger.info("CACHE HIT for files list.")
        # If it exists (Cache Hit), deserialize the JSON and return it.
        return json.loads(cached_files)

    # 2. If it's not in the cache (Cache Miss)...
    logger.info("CACHE MISS for files list. Fetching from source.")

    # 3. ...get the data from the source of truth (the filesystem/Git repo).
    #    (This is your existing logic from the function).
    if not REPO_PATH.exists() or not REPO_PATH.is_dir():
        raise HTTPException(status_code=500, detail="Server repository not found.")
    locks = load_locks()
    files = []
    # ... (the rest of your file-scanning for loop) ...

    # 4. Before returning, store the fresh data in the cache.
    # We use `setex` to set a Time-To-Live (TTL) of 5 minutes (300 seconds).
    redis_client.setex(cache_key, 300, json.dumps({"files": files}))

    return {"files": files}
```

**Checkpoint:** Restart your app (`docker-compose up -d --build`).

1.  Make a request to `/api/files`. Check your server logs (`docker-compose logs -f app`). You should see `CACHE MISS`.
2.  Make the same request again. You should see `CACHE HIT`. The response should be much faster, and the database/filesystem was not touched\!
3.  Wait 5 minutes and try again. It will be another `CACHE MISS` because the TTL expired.

---

## 13.4: Cache Invalidation

Our cache works, but it has a problem: if a user checks out a file, the cached file list will be stale for up to 5 minutes. We need to **invalidate** (delete) the cache key whenever the underlying data changes.

**Update your action endpoints in `main.py`:**

In `checkout_file`, `checkin_file`, and `upload_file`, add this single line after any successful state change (i.e., after your `save_locks` or `save_data_with_commit` call).

```python
# Example for checkout_file:
@app.post("/api/files/checkout")
async def checkout_file(request: FileCheckoutRequest, current_user: User = Depends(get_current_user)):
    # ... (all your existing validation and locking logic) ...

    save_locks(locks, current_user.username, commit_msg)

    # --- CACHE INVALIDATION ---
    # The list of files has changed, so we must delete the old cache.
    redis_client.delete("pdm:files_list")
    logger.info("Cache invalidated for files list.")

    await manager.broadcast(...) # Your existing broadcast call
    log_audit_event(...)
    return {"success": True, "message": "File checked out successfully"}
```

Apply the same `redis_client.delete("pdm:files_list")` line to `checkin_file` and `upload_file`.

**Checkpoint:**

1.  Hit `/api/files` to populate the cache (you'll see a MISS).
2.  Hit `/api/files` again to confirm a HIT.
3.  Now, check out a file using the UI.
4.  Hit `/api/files` one more time. It should be a `CACHE MISS` again, because the checkout action invalidated the cache. The endpoint fetches the fresh data from the source and re-populates the cache.

This combination of TTL-based expiration and explicit invalidation creates a highly performant and data-consistent caching strategy.

## Stage 13 Complete - A High-Performance Application\!

You've successfully integrated a powerful caching layer into your application, dramatically improving its performance and scalability. You've learned about core caching strategies, the importance of invalidation, and how to use a versatile tool like Redis.

### What's Next?

Your application is fast, secure, collaborative, and ready for production. The primary journey is complete. Future stages could explore even more advanced topics:

- **Background Tasks with Celery**: For long-running jobs (like processing large uploaded files) that shouldn't block the web server.
- **Full-Text Search with Elasticsearch**: For more advanced searching capabilities than simple string matching.
- **Metrics and Monitoring with Prometheus & Grafana**: To get deep visibility into your application's performance and health in production.
