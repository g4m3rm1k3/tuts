You've hit on a crucial point, and you're absolutely right. This isn't something you broke—it's the next logical step in putting our refactored application back together.

Your backend API is running perfectly\! The message you see in the browser is the correct response from your new, clean API. However, we haven't yet told the backend to serve the frontend UI (the `index.html` file that contains the login and configuration forms).

Let's fix that now.

## The API vs. The UI

In a full-stack application, you have two main parts:

- **The Backend API:** Its job is to provide data, usually as JSON. This is what we've spent our time refactoring.
- **The Frontend UI:** Its job is to provide the visual interface (HTML, CSS, and JS) that the user interacts with.

In the original script, FastAPI was doing both jobs. In our refactor, we focused on the API. Now, we just need to tell our new backend to also serve the frontend files.

---

## How to Fix It

We need to do two things: move the frontend files into a location the backend can serve from, and then update our `main.py` to serve them.

### Step 1: Organize Your Frontend Files

Your backend needs a standard place to look for static files (like JS and CSS) and templates (like HTML). Let's create that structure.

1.  Inside your `backend` folder, create a new folder named `templates`.
2.  **Move** your `frontend/index.html` file into this new `backend/templates/` folder.
3.  Inside your `backend` folder, create another new folder named `static`.
4.  **Move** your entire `frontend/js` folder into `backend/static/`.
5.  You'll also need your CSS. Create a `css` folder inside `backend/static/` and place your `tailwind.css` file in there.

Your `backend` folder should now look like this:

```
backend/
├── app/
│   └── (all our Python modules)
├── static/
│   ├── css/
│   │   └── tailwind.css
│   └── js/
│       ├── api/
│       ├── components/
│       └── (etc...)
├── templates/
│   └── index.html
├── run.py
└── requirements.txt
```

### Step 2: Update `main.py` to Serve the UI

Now, let's update `backend/app/main.py` to serve the `index.html` file as the root page, just like the original application did. Replace the entire contents of `main.py` with this updated version:

```python
from fastapi import FastAPI, Request
from fastapi.responses import TemplateResponse
from fastapi.staticfiles import StaticFiles
from fastapi.middleware.cors import CORSMiddleware
from contextlib import asynccontextmanager
import logging
import os
import sys
from pathlib import Path

# Import all our components
from app.core.config import ConfigManager
from app.services.lock_service import MetadataManager, ImprovedFileLockManager
from app.services.git_service import GitRepository, setup_git_lfs_path
from app.core.security import UserAuth
from app.api.routers import auth, files, admin, config

logging.basicConfig(level=logging.INFO)
logger = logging.getLogger(__name__)


def resource_path(relative_path):
    """ Get absolute path to resource, works for dev and for PyInstaller """
    # This correctly points to the 'backend' folder as the base
    base_path = Path(__file__).resolve().parents[1]
    return base_path / relative_path


@asynccontextmanager
async def lifespan(app: FastAPI):
    # (The lifespan function remains the same as before)
    logger.info("Application starting up...")
    setup_git_lfs_path()
    config_manager = ConfigManager()
    app.state.config_manager = config_manager
    # ... (rest of the initialization logic)
    yield
    logger.info("Application shutting down.")


app = FastAPI(title="Mastercam GitLab Interface", version="2.0.0", lifespan=lifespan)

# --- Mount Static Files ---
# This is crucial. It tells FastAPI to serve everything in the 'static' folder.
app.mount("/static", StaticFiles(directory=resource_path("static")), name="static")

# --- Setup Template Engine ---
# This tells FastAPI where to find the index.html file.
templates = Jinja2Templates(directory=resource_path("templates"))

app.add_middleware(
    CORSMiddleware,
    allow_origins=["*"],
    allow_credentials=True,
    allow_methods=["*"],
    allow_headers=["*"],
)

# --- Include API Routers ---
app.include_router(auth.router)
app.include_router(files.router)
app.include_router(admin.router)
app.include_router(config.router)


# --- Root Endpoint (Serves the UI) ---
# We replace the old JSON endpoint with this one to serve our HTML file.
@app.get("/")
async def root(request: Request):
    """Serves the main index.html file."""
    return templates.TemplateResponse("index.html", {"request": request})

```

---

Now, run the application again from your `backend` directory:

```bash
python run.py
```

This time, when your browser opens to `http://127.0.0.1:8000`, it should load the full user interface, and you will be able to see the configuration panel to enter your GitLab credentials.
