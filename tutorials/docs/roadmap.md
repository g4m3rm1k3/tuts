Absolutely — I can do that. Let’s break this into two parts: 1. A spruced-up summary of your requirements (so we have a clear mission statement). 2. A mega-hierarchy / master checklist of topics ordered in the way you would learn them while building your app, with theory, asides, and pivots interwoven for maximum learning.

Part 1: Requirements Summary

From everything you’ve said in our chats, here’s a distilled, professional summary of your goals and constraints:

⸻

Your Learning & Development Goals
• You want to build one app from scratch, but use it as a learning playground for every major concept a professional software engineer, systems designer, and computer scientist should know.
• The app should connect to GitLab, use Python + JavaScript, and include full-stack features.
• You want to learn by building, not by copying AI code — the AI-generated codebase you already have will be used only as a reference, not as the primary learning material.
• You want to iterate feature by feature, progressively learning:
• Backend (APIs, async patterns, security, databases)
• Frontend (DOM, async/await, frameworks, state management)
• DevOps (CI/CD, containers, cloud deployment)
• Systems design (monolith vs microservices, scaling, performance)
• Advanced CS topics (algorithms, distributed systems, compilers, theory of computation)
• You want asides / pivots in the project to practice alternate technologies, architectures, and trade-offs:
• Example: swap SQLite → Postgres → Mongo → Redis
• Example: REST → GraphQL → gRPC
• Example: React → Vue → Svelte
• Example: Monolith → microservice → serverless
• Example: Add ML/AI features, streaming, or blockchain as optional side experiments
• You want full mastery of the choices engineers make: design decisions, performance trade-offs, and real-world reasoning behind frameworks and architecture.
• You want a structured, hierarchical learning path that starts with absolute beginner concepts (Python hello world) and builds up to professional-grade software engineering, all while producing one evolving app.
• The final tutorial/roadmap should be comprehensive enough to produce >2000 lines of Markdown, covering practical, theoretical, and professional topics, with checkpoints, asides, and pivots.
• You want a playground mindset, where each new feature or concept:
• Is directly implementable in the app
• Is teachable through hands-on experimentation
• Can be swapped, broken, and rebuilt to deepen understanding

Part 2: Mega-Hierarchy / Master Checklist

Here’s a full learning roadmap structured as a progressive tutorial that builds the app feature by feature while teaching CS, engineering, and professional practices. I’ve interwoven asides, pivots, and theory at points where they are teachable and relevant.

⸻

✅ Notes on Progression
• Every stage builds on the previous.
• Pivots are optional, self-contained experiments that deepen understanding.
• Every stage has teachable asides: theory, alternate tech, or practical CS.
• This roadmap produces >2000 lines of Markdown if fully written out with examples, explanations, and experiments.

⸻

If you want, I can take this roadmap and start expanding it immediately into the first few stages of actual tutorial Markdown with runnable examples, exercises, and pivots — essentially producing your “living textbook” one stage at a time.

Do you want me to start that next?
