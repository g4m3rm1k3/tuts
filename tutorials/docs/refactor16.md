Of course. Now we'll create the "logistics department" for our frontend application‚Äîa dedicated module responsible for all communication with our backend.

---

### Stage 5.1: The API Service Layer

We will now create the file `api/service.js`. The sole purpose of this module is to contain all the `fetch` calls. No other part of our application will ever directly use `fetch`; they will all go through this API service.

#### The "Why"

This is a critical architectural pattern that provides immense benefits:

- **Single Responsibility:** This module's only job is to talk to the server. It doesn't know how to render HTML or manage user state; it just handles sending and receiving data.
- **Don't Repeat Yourself (DRY):** All the boilerplate for `fetch` requests (like setting headers for authentication, checking if the response was successful, and parsing JSON errors) is written **once**. This makes our code much cleaner and less error-prone.
- **Maintainability:** If a backend endpoint ever changes (e.g., from `/files` to `/api/v2/files`), you only need to update the URL in this one file. The rest of your application code remains untouched.
- **Testability:** When testing other parts of the app, we can easily create a "mock" API service that returns sample data without making real network calls. This makes our tests faster and more reliable.

#### Your Action Items

1. **Create the API Service File:** Create a new file at `frontend/js/api/service.js` and add the code below. We'll start by creating functions for a few of our key API calls.

```javascript
// frontend/js/api/service.js

const BASE_URL = ""; // The API is on the same origin, so we don't need a base URL.

/**
 * A helper function to handle the response from a fetch call.
 * It checks if the response was successful and throws an error with details if not.
 * @param {Response} response The fetch Response object.
 * @returns {Promise<any>} The JSON data from the response.
 */
async function handleResponse(response) {
  if (response.ok) {
    // If the response has content, parse it as JSON. Otherwise, return success.
    const contentType = response.headers.get("content-type");
    if (contentType && contentType.includes("application/json")) {
      return response.json();
    }
    return { status: "success" };
  } else {
    // If the server returned an error, parse the error detail and throw it.
    const errorData = await response.json();
    throw new Error(
      errorData.detail || `Request failed with status ${response.status}`
    );
  }
}

/**
 * Gets the current authentication token.
 * Later, we will get this from our state store, but localStorage is fine for now.
 * @returns {string|null} The auth token.
 */
function getAuthToken() {
  return localStorage.getItem("auth_token");
}

/**
 * Fetches the current application configuration summary.
 */
export async function getConfig() {
  const response = await fetch(`${BASE_URL}/config`);
  return handleResponse(response);
}

/**
 * Fetches the complete, grouped list of files.
 */
export async function getFiles() {
  const token = getAuthToken();
  const response = await fetch(`${BASE_URL}/files`, {
    headers: {
      Authorization: `Bearer ${token}`,
    },
  });
  return handleResponse(response);
}

/**
 * Sends a request to check out (lock) a file.
 * @param {string} filename The name of the file to check out.
 * @param {string} user The user checking out the file.
 */
export async function checkoutFile(filename, user) {
  const token = getAuthToken();
  const response = await fetch(`${BASE_URL}/files/${filename}/checkout`, {
    method: "POST",
    headers: {
      "Content-Type": "application/json",
      Authorization: `Bearer ${token}`,
    },
    body: JSON.stringify({ user: user }),
  });
  return handleResponse(response);
}

// We will add more functions here for checkin, login, etc., as we need them.
```

2. **Use the New Service:** Now, let's see how to use this service. Update your `frontend/js/main.js` file to import and call these new functions. This demonstrates how cleanly our modules will interact.

```javascript
// frontend/js/main.js

// Import functions from our new modules!
import { formatDate } from "./utils/helpers.js";
import { getConfig, getFiles } from "./api/service.js";

console.log("Application main.js loaded!");
console.log("Current date formatted:", formatDate(new Date()));

document.addEventListener("DOMContentLoaded", async function () {
  console.log("DOM fully loaded. Initializing app...");

  try {
    // Use our new API service to fetch initial data
    const config = await getConfig();
    console.log("‚úÖ Config loaded successfully:", config);

    // For now, we'll assume the user is authenticated for this test
    if (config.has_token) {
      const files = await getFiles();
      console.log("‚úÖ Files loaded successfully:", files);
    } else {
      console.log("üèÉ App is not configured. Skipping file load.");
    }
  } catch (error) {
    console.error("‚ùå Initialization failed:", error.message);
  }

  // The rest of our app initialization logic will go here.
});
```

---

We have now successfully created a dedicated, professional "data layer" for our frontend. From now on, whenever our application needs to talk to the server, it will use a function from this `service.js` module.

Let me know when you're ready, and we'll tackle the most transformative part of the frontend refactor: creating the central state store.
