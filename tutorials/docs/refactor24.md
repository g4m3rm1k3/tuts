Excellent\! Let's bring it all together and run your newly refactored application.

You've successfully completed a full-stack refactoring project. We've transformed this application from two monolithic scripts into a professional, modern, and maintainable system. We applied critical software architecture principles like **Separation of Concerns**, **Dependency Injection**, and a **Single Source of Truth** to make the code robust and scalable.

## Final Checklist

Before we run the application, let's do a quick check to ensure your project structure matches our final blueprint.

### Backend Structure

Your `backend` folder should look like this:

```
backend/
├── app/
│  ├── api/
│  │  ├── dependencies.py
│  │  └── routers/
│  │    ├── admin.py
│  │    ├── auth.py
│  │    ├── config.py
│  │    └── files.py
│  ├── core/
│  │  ├── config.py
│  │  └── security.py
│  ├── models/
│  │  └── schemas.py
│  └── services/
│    ├── git_service.py
│    └── lock_service.py
├── run.py
└── requirements.txt
```

_(The original `mastercam_main.py` should be deleted.)_

### Frontend Structure

Your `frontend` folder, which contains your `index.html`, should have a `js` subfolder that looks like this:

```
frontend/
└── js/
  ├── api/
  │  └── service.js
  ├── components/
  │  ├── ConfigPanel.js
  │  ├── DashboardModal.js
  │  ├── CheckinModal.js
  │  ├── FileCard.js
  │  ├── Modal.js
  │  └── NewUploadModal.js
  ├── services/
  │  └── websocket.js
  ├── state/
  │  └── store.js
  └── utils/
    └── helpers.js
```

_(The original `script.js` should be deleted.)_

## How to Run Your Application

Follow these steps from your terminal:

### Step 1: Install Backend Dependencies

Navigate into your backend directory.

```bash
cd path/to/your/project/mastercam-pdm/backend
```

Now, install all the necessary libraries using our `requirements.txt` file. This is the "recipe" that sets up your Python environment.

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### Step 2: Run the Backend Server

Stay in the `backend` directory and run the application using our new entrypoint script.

```bash
python run.py
```

You should see output from the Uvicorn server indicating that it has started, likely on `http://127.0.0.1:8000`. Your `run.py` script will also automatically open this URL in your default web browser.

## What to Expect: The New Flow

When the application loads, you are now seeing your refactored code in action:

1. The browser loads `index.html`, which now loads `main.js` as a module.
2. `main.js`'s `DOMContentLoaded` listener fires.
3. The `initialize` function calls our `api/service.js` to fetch the configuration.
4. The response is used to update our `state/store.js` via `setState()`.
5. The store automatically notifies its subscriber—the `render()` function.
6. The `render()` function gets the new state and builds the UI by creating `FileCard` components, appending them to the DOM.
7. The `connectWebSocket()` service is called, establishing the real-time connection.

Congratulations on completing this extensive and educational refactoring project\! You now have a solid, professional foundation that you can confidently build upon.
