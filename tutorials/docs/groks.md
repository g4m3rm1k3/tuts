### Revised Tutorial: Step-by-Step Walkthrough

Absolutely, let's do this systematically. I'll go through the tutorial **section by section**, revising based on my earlier assessment. Revisions focus on:

- **Clarity:** Adding analogies, reflection prompts, and cross-references.
- **Accuracy:** Fixing minor code issues (e.g., imports, edge cases) via spot-checks with code execution.
- **Learning Emphasis:** More "why" explanations, edge-case handling, and prompts to encourage thinking.
- **Structure:** Adding prerequisites recap, visuals suggestions, and task-based flow.
- **Length:** Keeping it concise; no bloat.

I'll revise **one major section (or 2-3 levels) at a time** to avoid overwhelming the response. At the end of each, I'll note changes and ask if you want to proceed to the next. We can iterate until complete.

To verify code, I used the `code_execution` tool on key snippets (e.g., FastAPI endpoints return expected JSON; no errors).

#### **Revised Intro: Product & Design Specification**

**Original Strengths:** Excellent "North Star" with user stories and tech rationale.

**Revisions:** Added "Success Criteria" for measurability; clarified prerequisites; added visual suggestion.

### ## At the Beginning: The Product & Design Specification

Before the "Prerequisites" and "Initial Setup," this section outlines how to think about the project from a high level before writing a single line of code. It acts as a blueprint and "North Star," explaining not just _what_ we're building, but _why_ we're making certain decisions.

**Success Criteria:** By the end, you'll have a deployable app that: (1) Handles 10+ concurrent users with secure checkouts/checkins; (2) Syncs changes to GitLab in <5s; (3) Passes all automated tests on refresh.

### 1. The High-Level Vision (The "Elevator Pitch")

Every project needs a clear mission statement. This defines the core problem and the proposed solution. _Analogy:_ Think of this as the "executive summary" of a business plan—concise enough for a 30-second pitch.

- **The Problem:** Managing shared engineering files (like Mastercam files) on a network drive is chaotic. It's difficult to know who is working on what, there's no audit trail for changes, and it's easy for someone to accidentally overwrite critical work. Users are not Git experts and cannot be expected to use the command line.
- **The Solution:** A secure, simple, web-based application that acts as the sole gateway to a GitLab repository. It provides a user-friendly interface for non-technical users to follow a robust Product Data Management (PDM) workflow (checkout, checkin, revision control) without ever touching Git directly.
- **Core Value:** The application provides the safety and auditability of a version control system while presenting a simple, intuitive UI tailored to a specific engineering workflow.

### 2. User Stories (Defining the Features)

Instead of just listing features, modern development uses **user stories** to describe functionality from an end-user's perspective. They follow a simple format: `As a <role>, I want <action>, so that <benefit>`. This keeps the focus on delivering real value. _Why this format?_ It forces us to think about the _user's goal_, not just the tech.

Here are some of the key features we've built, framed as user stories:

- **File Viewing:** "As a **user**, I want to see a list of all files grouped by their part number, so that I can easily find the file I'm looking for."
- **Checkout/Checkin:** "As a **user**, I want to 'check out' a file, so that I can signal to my team that I am actively working on it and prevent editing conflicts."
- **History:** "As a **user**, I want to view the version history of a file and download old versions, so that I can review past changes or recover from a mistake."
- **Admin Permissions:** "As an **admin**, I want to be able to edit the metadata of any file, so that I can correct errors and maintain data integrity for my department."
- **Supervisor Permissions:** "As a **supervisor**, I want to be the only one who can grant admin privileges, so that I can securely control high-level access to the system."

**Reflection Prompt:** How might you adapt a user story if a stakeholder requested "mobile support"?

### 3. The Technical Design (The Blueprint)

This section outlines the high-level technical decisions—the "how" that supports the "what" from the user stories. _Suggestion: Add a simple diagram here (e.g., via draw.io) showing Client → API → GitLab flow._

- **Tech Stack:**

  - **Backend (FastAPI):** Chosen for its high performance, modern Python features, automatic API documentation (which we've used for testing), and ease of use for building secure REST APIs. _Why not Flask?_ FastAPI's async support scales better for concurrent users.
  - **Frontend (Vanilla JavaScript):** Chosen to teach foundational web development concepts (DOM manipulation, `fetch` API, event handling) without the complexity of a large framework. _Edge Case:_ For production, consider Vue.js if state grows complex.
  - **Data Store (GitLab Repository):** Chosen to be the "single source of truth." Instead of a traditional database, we use a Git repository to store all data and metadata as version-controlled files, providing a complete audit trail.
  - **Authentication (GitLab Tokens):** Chosen to leverage the existing source of truth for user identity, avoiding the need to manage a separate password database.

- **Core Architectural Principles:**
  - **Client-Server Model:** A strict separation between the backend (which manages all data and logic) and the frontend (which is only responsible for presentation). _Analogy:_ Backend is the chef; frontend is the waiter—don't mix the kitchen with the dining room.
  - **Stateless API with JWT:** The backend doesn't remember who is logged in between requests. Every secure request must be accompanied by a JSON Web Token (JWT), which the server validates. This makes the application highly scalable and secure.
  - **Configuration as Code:** All application configuration (settings, user roles, etc.) is stored in version-controlled files within the Git repository. The state of the app _is_ the state of the repository.

By adding this section to the beginning of your tutorial, you're creating a professional design document that explains not just what the tutorial builds, but, more importantly, _*why*_ it's built that way.

**Visual Suggestion:** Insert a screenshot of a high-level architecture diagram here (e.g., boxes for Frontend, Backend, GitLab with arrows).

### Revised Prerequisites & Initial Setup

**Original Strengths:** Concise and actionable; covers essentials.

**Revisions:** Expanded with troubleshooting tips (robustness); added "curve ball" scenario (e.g., "What if venv fails?"); detailed commands with explanations; visual suggestions; reflection on why each step matters. Added a "Quick Sanity Check" table for verification. This sets a robust foundation, simulating a real build where things might go wrong.

---

### Prerequisites

Before diving into the code, ensure your environment is set up correctly. This is like prepping your toolbox before building a house—skipping it leads to frustration later. _Why these specifically?_ We're using modern Python for the backend (async, type-safe) and vanilla JS for the frontend (lightweight, no build tools), so no heavy frameworks yet.

#### Required Software & Versions

- **Python 3.9+** (Recommended: 3.11 for better async perf). Download from [python.org](https://www.python.org/downloads/). _Why?_ FastAPI leverages Python's async/await for handling concurrent requests (e.g., multiple users checking out files).
- **Git 2.30+** (For version control; we'll integrate it deeply). Install from [git-scm.com](https://git-scm.com/downloads).
- **Git LFS** (For large files like .mcam). Install via [git-lfs.github.com](https://git-lfs.github.com/) after Git. _Curve Ball:_ If LFS install fails (e.g., on corporate firewalls), fallback to manual uploads <50MB—add a config flag later.
- **Code Editor:** VS Code (free, with Python/JS extensions). _Why VS Code?_ Built-in terminal, linting, and Git integration speed up debugging.
- **GitLab Account:** Free tier works. Create a project for our repo. _Tip:_ Enable LFS quota in project settings (default 1GB; upgrade if needed).

#### Initial Project Setup

Follow these steps in order. Run commands in your terminal (e.g., VS Code's integrated one). _Robustness Note:_ If a command fails, check your PATH (e.g., `echo $PATH` on Mac/Linux)—Python/Git must be in it. On Windows, restart terminal after installs.

1. **Create Project Folder:**

   ```
   mkdir pdm_tutorial
   cd pdm_tutorial
   ```

   _Why?_ Keeps everything isolated. _Visual Suggestion:_ Screenshot your folder tree here (e.g., via `tree` command or VS Code explorer).

2. **Set Up Python Virtual Environment:**

   ```
   python -m venv venv
   ```

   - **Activate It:**
     - Windows: `venv\Scripts\activate`
     - Mac/Linux: `source venv/bin/activate`
       _Why venv?_ Isolates dependencies—prevents conflicts if you have other Python projects. _Curve Ball:_ If `python` not found, install/reinstall Python and add to PATH. Reflection: How does this compare to global installs? (Hint: Reproducibility for teams.)

3. **Install Dependencies:**
   Create `requirements.txt`:

   ```
   fastapi
   uvicorn[standard]
   jinja2
   aiofiles
   ```

   Then:

   ```
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

   _Why these?_ FastAPI (API framework), Uvicorn (server), Jinja2 (HTML templating), Aiofiles (async file I/O for uploads). _Robustness:_ Run `pip freeze > requirements.lock` for exact versions—pin them (e.g., `fastapi==0.104.1`) to avoid "works on my machine" issues.

4. **Create Folder Structure:**

   ```
   mkdir templates static static/css static/js repo
   touch templates/index.html static/css/style.css static/js/script.js
   ```

   _Why this structure?_ `templates/` for HTML, `static/` for assets (served directly), `repo/` for files. _Visual Suggestion:_ Insert a screenshot of the folder tree post-setup.

5. **Initial Data Files:**
   Create these empty JSON files in the root (for local mode; we'll Git-ify later):
   - `locks.json`: `{}`
   - `metadata.json`: `{}`
   - `roles.json`: `{"local_user": "admin"}` (simulate users)
   - `settings.json`: `{"revision_separator": "-"}`

**Quick Sanity Check Table:**

| Step          | Command/Output        | Expected                            | If Fails...                             |
| ------------- | --------------------- | ----------------------------------- | --------------------------------------- |
| Venv Activate | Prompt shows `(venv)` | Green prompt change                 | Reinstall Python; check `which python`. |
| Pip Install   | No errors             | Packages listed in `pip list`       | Run `pip cache purge`; retry.           |
| Folder Tree   | `ls -la`              | Shows `templates/`, `static/`, etc. | Manual `mkdir` if autocmd fails.        |

**Reflection Prompt:** Why isolate data files like `locks.json` now? How might this evolve if we add a DB later? (Hint: Migration path.)

Run `uvicorn main:app --reload` (after Level 1) to test—visit `http://127.0.0.1:8000`. If issues, check logs for "port in use" (kill with `lsof -i :8000` on Mac).
