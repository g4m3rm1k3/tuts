# **Requirements Document for “Ultimate Python Mastery Tutorial”**

## **1. Purpose**

The purpose of this tutorial is to provide a **project-based, comprehensive learning path** that takes a user with basic Python experience (understanding variables, loops, and basic data types) to **professional-level mastery**. The tutorial will teach Python language features, standard libraries, third-party libraries, computer science principles, software engineering practices, design patterns, security, cryptography, data structures and algorithms (DSA), and application development.

The goal is to enable the learner to:

- **Confidently read documentation** and integrate new libraries.
- **Architect, design, and implement complex projects** using Python.
- Apply software engineering principles such as clean code, testing, version control, and maintainability.
- Understand Python internals for performance optimization and problem-solving.
- Transition from learning Python to functioning as a **professional Python software engineer**.

---

## **2. Scope**

The tutorial will cover:

- **Python language mastery:** syntax, semantics, OOP, functional programming, type hints, decorators, metaclasses.
- **Python standard library:** modules essential for real-world applications (`os`, `sys`, `pathlib`, `collections`, `itertools`, `asyncio`, `subprocess`, `logging`, `dataclasses`, etc.).
- **Popular third-party libraries:** pip-installable tools for web development, data science, GUI, async programming, networking, and testing (`requests`, `FastAPI`, `Flask`, `numpy`, `pandas`, `matplotlib`, `pytest`, `rich`, `typer`, etc.).
- **Computer Science Foundations:** algorithms, data structures, complexity, design patterns.
- **Software Engineering Practices:** clean code, modular architecture, testing, version control, documentation, deployment.
- **Security and Cryptography:** password hashing, symmetric/asymmetric encryption, secure APIs, authentication/authorization.
- **Project-based Learning:** all topics taught through **purposeful projects**, where libraries and concepts are applied repeatedly across projects to reinforce learning.

---

## **3. Tutorial Requirements**

### **3.1 General Requirements**

1. The tutorial should be **project-based**, with each project introducing new topics while reinforcing previously learned concepts.
2. **Repetition occurs only for reinforcement or application**, not for trivial exercises. For example:

   - venv usage appears in all projects, but each project uses it meaningfully for dependency isolation.
   - Logging, testing, and modular design are reused across multiple projects.

3. The tutorial should **include references to documentation**, PEPs, and external authoritative resources to encourage independent learning.
4. Each section should include:

   - Explanations of **why** a concept or library is used.
   - Detailed **code walkthroughs**, including line-by-line commentary for advanced topics.
   - **Exercises or mini-challenges** that deepen understanding in context of the current project.

5. Projects should **incrementally increase in complexity**, combining multiple concepts from previous lessons.

### **3.3 Project Guidelines**

- Each project should:

  1. Introduce a **primary concept or library**.
  2. Reuse **previous libraries and patterns** for reinforcement.
  3. Be **complex enough to demonstrate real-world engineering challenges**, but achievable.
  4. Include **tests, logging, and virtual environment setup**.
  5. Have **documentation** and references to relevant Python docs and PEPs.

- Example Projects (progressive complexity):

  1. **Data manager CLI app** – CRUD operations with JSON/SQLite, logging, and testing.
  2. **Web API service** – FastAPI backend for notes or tasks, async handling, security/authentication.
  3. **Data analysis & visualization tool** – Process CSV/JSON data, visualize with matplotlib/pandas.
  4. **GUI app** – Build interactive notes/task manager with PySide or Tkinter.
  5. **Async real-time application** – Websockets-based live updates, using async patterns.
  6. **Advanced project** – Combine multiple domains: web, async, GUI, data persistence, cryptography, DSA.
