You're absolutely right. That's an excellent observation and a crucial step for making this a true masterclass. The original syllabus was a high-level overview of the _concepts_, but you want a roadmap for the _features_.

Your approach of incrementally building each feature is the professional way to do it. Each feature will be a "vertical slice" where we touch every part of the stack—from the backend database/logic to the API endpoint to the frontend API service to the final UI button. This repetition is what builds mastery.

Let's revise the syllabus to reflect this feature-driven, iterative approach.

### **The Full-Stack VCS App Masterclass: Detailed Feature Roadmap**

We'll keep the high-level Modules, but we'll break down the core logic into specific, tangible features from your application.

#### **Module 1 & 2: The Foundation (✓ Completed)**

We have already completed this foundational work.

- **Part 1:** Backend Setup
- **Part 2:** Data Modeling & Core "Read" API
- **Part 3:** Frontend Scaffolding
- **Part 4:** Connecting Frontend to Backend (Read-Only)

---

#### **Module 3: The Interactive Core (Building Feature by Feature)**

This is the new, granular section. We will build out the application's interactivity, one complete feature at a time.

- **Part 5: Feature Slice 1 - The "Checkout" Workflow**

  - **Goal:** Allow a user to lock a file for editing.
  - **Backend:** Implement the `POST /api/files/{filename}/checkout` endpoint. We'll start by having it just update our mock database.
  - **Frontend:** Add the "Checkout" button to the `FileCard` component. Write the `checkoutFile` function in our `service.js`. Wire up a click event listener that calls the service, and then refreshes the file list to show the updated status.

- **Part 6: Feature Slice 2 - "Cancel Checkout" (Repetition & Reinforcement)**

  - **Goal:** Allow the user who checked out a file to unlock it.
  - **Backend:** Implement the `POST /api/files/{filename}/cancel` endpoint.
  - **Frontend:** Add the "Cancel" button. This will reinforce the exact pattern from Part 5 (add button -> create service function -> wire event listener -> refresh UI), solidifying your understanding.

- **Part 7: Feature Slice 3 - "Check-In" (Handling Forms & File Uploads)**

  - **Goal:** Allow a user to upload a new version of a file with a comment.
  - **Backend:** Implement `POST /api/files/{filename}/checkin`. This is a major step, as we'll learn how to handle multipart/form-data, including both a file upload and text data (the check-in comment) in a single request.
  - **Frontend:** Build our first modal dialog for the check-in form. We'll write the JavaScript to show/hide the modal and handle the form submission, sending `FormData` to the backend.

- **Part 8: Feature Slice 4 - "View History" (Handling Complex Data)**

  - **Goal:** Let a user see the revision history of a file.
  - **Backend:** Implement the `GET /api/files/{filename}/history` endpoint. We'll model what a "history event" looks like and return a list of them.
  - **Frontend:** Build the "History" modal. We'll make an API call when the user clicks the history button and then dynamically render the list of historical events inside the modal.

- **Part 9: Feature Slice 5 - Admin Actions ("Override" & "Delete")**
  - **Goal:** Implement actions that only an admin should perform.
  - **Backend:** Implement the `POST /api/files/{filename}/override` and `DELETE /api/files/{filename}` endpoints.
  - **Frontend:** Add the "Override" and "Delete" buttons. We'll introduce a simple boolean flag (`isAdmin = true`) on the frontend to control whether these buttons are visible, introducing the concept of conditional rendering.

---

#### **Module 4: Realism & Persistence**

Now that the UI and API contracts are fully built, we swap out the "mock" parts for the real thing.

- **Part 10: The Real Git Engine**

  - **Goal:** Replace our mock backend logic with real Git operations.
  - **Backend:** We'll install `GitPython` and go back through every one of our feature endpoints (`checkout`, `checkin`, `history`, etc.) and replace the mock database manipulations with actual Git commands. The frontend won't have to change at all!

- **Part 11: Making it Permanent - Database Integration**
  - **Goal:** Store file metadata (like descriptions) that doesn't belong in Git.
  - **Backend:** Introduce `SQLite` and `SQLAlchemy`. We'll create a database table for our files and modify our endpoints to fetch and save metadata to this database, while still using Git for versioning.

---

#### **Module 5 & 6: Production Readiness (Security, Real-Time & Deployment)**

These modules remain conceptually the same but are now correctly placed after the core application is fully functional.

- **Part 12:** Fort Knox - Authentication & User Security
- **Part 13:** Going Live - Real-Time Updates with WebSockets
- **Part 14:** Bulletproofing Your App - Testing & Debugging
- **Part 15:** Shipping It - Deployment & Beyond

This revised roadmap ensures we build **every feature** from your app in a logical, repetitive, and deeply educational way.

Does this detailed, feature-driven plan look better to you? If so, we can begin immediately with **Part 5: Feature Slice 1 - The "Checkout" Workflow**.
